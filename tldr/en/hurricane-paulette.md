short_summary: "Category 2 Atlantic hurricane in 2020"
description: "Hurricane Paulette was a strong and long-lived Category 2 atlantic Hurricane which became the first to landfall in Bermuda since Hurricane Gonzalo made Landfall in. Paulette the Sixteenth named Storm and the sixth Hurricane of the atlantic Hurricane Season 2020 Record-Breaking Season developed from a tropical Wave that left the Coast of Africa on September 2. The Wave eventually consolidated into a tropical Depression on 7 September. The Intensity of Paulette fluctuated over the next few Days due to the strong Wind Shear which peaked on September 8 initially as a strong tropical Storm. It eventually strengthened into a Hurricane early on September 13 as Shear decreased. On september 14 Paulette made Landfall in northeastern Bermuda as a Category2 Hurricane while turning to the Northeast. The Cyclone strengthened further as it moved away from the Island reaching its Peak Intensity on 14 September with sustained Winds of 1 Minute of 105mph and a minimum central atmospheric Pressure of 965mbar. On the Evening of september 15 Paulette began to weaken and undergo the extratropical Transition which completed on September 16. The Hurricane's extratropical Remnants persisted and moved southward then eastward, and eventually, Paulette regenerated into a tropical Storm early on September 20 South of the Azores– which resulted in the U. S national Weather Service coined the Phrase Zombie Storm to describe its unusual Regeneration. Paulette's second Phase however proved short-lived as the Storm quickly weakened and became posttropical again two Days later. The Remnant persisted for several Days before dissipating South of the Azores on 28 September. In total, Paulette was a tropical Cyclone for 11. The System had an overall Lifespan of 21 Days."
