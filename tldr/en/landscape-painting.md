short_summary: "Depiction of landscapes in art"
description: "Landscape Painting, also known as Landscape Art, is the Depiction of natural Scenery such as Mountains, Valleys, Trees, Rivers, and Forests, especially where the main Subject is a wide View—With its Elements arranged into a coherent Composition. Landscape Backgrounds for Figures can still form an important Part of other Works. Sky is almost always included in the View, and Weather is often an Element of the Composition. Detail Landscapes are not found in all artistic Traditions as a separate Subject and Develop when there is already a sophisticated Tradition of representing other Subjects."
