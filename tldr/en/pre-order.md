description: "A Pre-Order is a Purchase placed for an Item that has n't been yet released. The Idea for Pre-Orders came because People were finding it hard to get popular Items in Stores because of their Popularity. Companies then had the Idea to allow Customers to reserve their own personal Copy before its Release, which has been a huge Success."
