short_summary: "Music of the video game L.A. Noire"
description: "The Soundtrack for the 2011 neo-noir detective Video Game L. A. Noire, developed by Team Bondi and published by Rockstar Games, was composed by Musicians Andrew Hale and Simon Hale. The Score was recorded at abbey Road Studios in London and also Features Contributions by Woody Jackson who had previously and since worked with Rockstar on other Projects. Andrew Hale felt that composing the Game's Score was about setting a Mood, attempting to compose Music that felt accessible to Players. The Score was inspired by Films from the 1940s, though the Team avoided specifically composing for this Time Period, instead opting to focus on that after the Music had been produced. Three supplementary vocal Recordings were composed by the Real Tuesday Weld and performed by Claudia Brücken ; they also sought to fit with the Game's Setting."
