Its finely decorated Leather Binding is the earliest known western Bookbinding to survive, and both the 94 Vellum Folios and the Binding are in outstanding Condition for a Book of this Age. The St Cuthbert Gospel with a Page Size of only 138 by 92 Millimetres is one of the smallest surviving anglo-saxon Manuscripts. The largely undecorated Text is the Gospel of John in latin written in a Script that has been regarded as a Model of Elegance Simplicity."
