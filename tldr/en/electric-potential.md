title: "Electric potential"
short_summary: "Line integral of the electric field"
description: "Electric Potential is defined as the Amount of Work Energy required per Unit of electric Charge to move the Charge from a Reference Point to a particular Point in an electric Field. The electric Potential is more precisely the Energy per Unit Charge for a Test Charge that is so small that the Disturbance of the Field under Consideration is negligible. The Motion over the Field is supposed to proceed with a negligible Acceleration so as to avoid the Test Charge acquiring kinetic Energy or producing Radiation. The electric Potential at the Reference Point is by Definition zero Units. The Reference Point is typically earth or an Infinity Point although any Point can be used."
