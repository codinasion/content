short_summary: "Faked dinosaur discovery in China"
description: "Archaeoraptor is the informal generic Name for a fossil Chimera from China published in 1999 in national geographic Magazine. The Magazine stated the Fossil was a missing Link between Birds and the terrestrial Theropod Dinosaurs. Even before this Publication there had been serious Doubts about the Fossil's Authenticity. A further scientific Study found it to be a Forgery constructed from rearranged Pieces of real Fossils from different Species. Zhou et Al. The Head and Body belong to a Specimen of the primitive Fossil Bird Yanornis. A 2002 Study found that the Tail belongs to a small Winged Dromaeosaur called Microraptor which was named in 2000. The legs and feet belong to an as-yet-unknown-animal."
