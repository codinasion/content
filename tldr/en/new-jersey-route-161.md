short_summary: "State highway in Clifton, New Jersey, United States"
description: "Route 161 is a 1. 10 Miles State Highway in Clifton, New Jersey, United States, running along Clifton Avenue between Allwood Road and Van Houten Avenue. Although it is a signed State Highway it does not connect to any other state-maintained Roadways. However, the south terminus is aligned just northeast of the interchange of RouteÂ 3 and the Garden State Parkway. The Highway originated as Route S3 Spur, a suffixed Spur of State Highway Route 3 to State Highway Route 6. The Route was redesignated in 1953 as Route 161, though in one late 1950s Essex County Hagstrom Map and in the Nj Highway Code for Mid-Block Crosswalks the Highway is shown as Route 61. It is unknown whether Route 61 existed."
