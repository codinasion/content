description: "The 1952 World Snooker Championship was a Snooker Tournament that took Place between 25 february and 8 March 1952 at Houldsworth Hall in Manchester England. The Event had only two Entries australian Horace Lindrum and new Zealander Clark Mcconachy. Due to a Dispute between the professional Billiards Players' Association and the Billiards Association and control Council most Players have withdrew from the Event. The Bacc thought the Championship was primarily about Honour, and financial Consideration should come second, whilst the Pbpa Disagreed. The Pbpa established an alternative'world Championship' called the Pbpa Snooker Championship which later became the official World Championship as the World professional Match-Play Championship."
