title: "Battle of Huoyi"
short_summary: "Part of Tang expansion in 617"
description: "The Battle of Huoyi was fought on 8 September 617 in China between the rebel Duke of Tang Li Yuan and the Army of the Ruling Sui Dynasty. Li Yuan was moving south along the Fen River toward the imperial Capital Daxingcheng with an Army of around 25000. His Advance was stalled for two Weeks due to heavy Rains and he was greeted by an elite sui Army of 20000 Men in the Town of Huoyi. Li Yuan's Cavalry under the Command of his two eldest Sons lured the Sui out of the Protection of the City Walls but in the first Clash between the two main Armies li Yuan's Forces were initially driven back. At that point, possibly due to a stratagem on Li Yuan's behalf, the arrival of the rest of the rebel army, or to the flanking maneuver of Li Yuan's cavalry, which had gotten behind the Sui army, the Sui troops collapsed and routed, fleeing back towards Huoyi. The Cavalry of li Yuan however cut off their Retreat. The Battle was followed by the Capture of weakly-defended Huoyi and the Advance on Daxingcheng which fell in November to the Rebels. In the next Year, Li Yuan deposed the Sui and proclaimed himself Emperor, beginning the Tang Dynasty."
