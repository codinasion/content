description: "Hernan was the Second of three Category 5 Hurricanes during the 2002 Pacific Hurricane Season. The 12th tropical Cyclone Tenth named Storm and sixth Hurricane of the Season Hernan originated from a tropical Wave that formed in the atlantic Ocean and crossed to the Pacific Ocean. The Wave spawned a low-pressure Area which was then organized into a tropical Depression on 30 August a tropical Storm on 31 August and a Hurricane later that Day. Hernan quickly intensified and reached peak Intensity as a Category 5 Storm on the saffir-simpson Hurricane Scale. It was going northwest to maintain its Strength for eight Hours but on september 2 it entered Cooler Waters and began to weaken. By september 6 the Region had degenerated into a remnant Area of low Pressure."
