description: "There are literary, archaeological, epigraphic and numismatic sources of ancient Tamil history. The Foremost among these Sources is the sangam Literature generally dating back to the 5th Century Bce to the 3rd Century Ce. The Poems in sangam Literature Contain vivid Descriptions of the different Aspects of Life and Society in Tamilakam during this Age scholars agree that these are for the most Part reliable Accounts. Greek and Roman Literature, around the Dawn of the Christian Era, give Details of the Maritime Trade between Tamilakam and the Roman Empire, including the Names and Locations of many Ports on both Coasts of the Tamil Country. There are Evidences as could be seen comparing standard Forms of sumerian Literature and those recovered through present Form of Tamil, for Example the Word for Father in sumerian Transliteration is given as, 'a-ia' that could easily be compared with Tamil Word, 'Ayya'. This also places ancient Form of Tamil to early sumerian Period, say as ancient as 3500 Bc."
