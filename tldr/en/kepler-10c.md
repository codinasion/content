short_summary: "Exoplanet in the constellation Draco"
description: "Kepler-10C is an Exoplanet orbiting the kepler-10-type Star located in Draco around 608 light Years away. Its Discovery was announced by Kepler in may 2011 although it had been seen as a Planet Candidate since January 2011 when Kepler-10B was discovered. The Researchers confirmed the Study using nasa's spitzer Telescope Data and a Technique called Blender that ruled out most false Positives. Kepler-10C was the third transiting Planet to be statistically confirmed after Kepler-9D and Kepler-11G. The Kepler Team considers the statistical Method that led to the Discovery of Kepler-10C as necessary to confirm many Planets in Kepler's Field of View."
