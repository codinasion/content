short_summary: "Pacific typhoon in 2002"
description: "Fengshen was the strongest Storm of the Pacific Typhoon Season 2002. It developed from a Monsoon Trough near the Marshall islands on July 13 and quickly intensified because of its small Size. By July 15 Fengshen attained Typhoon Status and after initially moving to the North it turned northwest. The Typhoon reached its maximum Intensity of 185 Kmh on 18 July according to the Japan meteorological Agency. The joint Typhoon warning Center estimated peak Winds at 270 Kmh and the Agency estimated that Fengshen was a super Typhoon for five Days. This broke the Record for longest Duration at that Intensity, previously set by Typhoon Joan in 1997, and which was later tied by Typhoon Ioke in 2006."
