short_summary: "Hurricane season in the Atlantic Ocean"
description: "The atlantic Hurricane Season of 1973 was a under average tropical Cyclone Season. Of the 24 tropical or subtropical Cyclones that developed only 8 became named Storms and of those only 4 became Hurricanes with one reaching major Hurricane Status on the newly implemented Saffirsimpson Hurricane wind Scale. This continued the Pattern of Storm Activity from the previous Season, as hostile El Niño–Southern Oscillation Conditions again hindered tropical Cyclogenesis and Intensification in the tropical Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea."
