title: "Thermoregulation"
short_summary: "Ability of an organism to keep its body temperature within certain boundaries"
description: "Thermoregulation is the Ability of an Organism to maintain a Temperature within certain Boundaries even when the Surrounding Temperature is different. A thermoconforming Organism simply adopts the surrounding Temperature as its own Body Temperature thus avoiding the Need for internal Thermoregulation. The internal Thermoregulation Process is an Aspect of Homeostasis a State of dynamic Stability in an Organism's internal Conditions maintained far from thermal Equilibrium with its Environment. If the Body is unable to maintain a normal Temperature and the Temperature grows significantly above normal a Condition known as Hyperthermia Occurs. Lethal Hyperthermia can also happen to Humans when the Wet Bulb Temperature is sustained for six Hours above 35c. Work in 2022 established by Experiment that a wet-bulb Temperature exceeding 30. 55Â°c caused uncompensable Heat Stress in young, healthy Adult Humans. In Contrast to hypothermia the opposite Condition occurs when the Body Temperature drops below normal Levels. It occurs when the homeostatic Control Mechanisms of the Heat within the Body Malfunction causing the Body to lose Heat faster than producing it. Normal Body Temperature is around 37c and hypothermia Sets in when the Core Body Temperature is below 35c. Hypothermia is usually caused by prolonged Exposure to cold Temperatures usually treated by Methods that try to raise the Body Temperature back to a normal Range. It was not until the Introduction of Thermometers that any exact Data on the Temperature of Animals could be obtained. It was then found that local Differences are present since Heat Production and Heat Loss vary significantly in different Parts of the Body although Circulation of the Blood tends to bring about a mean Temperature of the internal Parts. Therefore it is important to identify the Parts of the Body which closely reflect the Temperature of the internal Organs. To be comparable these Measurements must also be conducted under comparable Conditions. The Rectum has traditionally been considered to reflect most accurately the Temperature of internal Parts, or in some Cases of Sex or Species, the Vagina, Uterus or Bladder."
