short_summary: "Goddess who represents, or is a personification of nature, motherhood, fertility, creation"
description: "A Mother Goddess is a major Goddess characterized as a Mother or Progenitor, either as an Embodiment of Motherhood and Fertility or fulfilling the cosmological Role of a creator- And/Or Destroyer-Figure, typically associated the Earth, Sky, and/or the life-giving Bounties thereof in a maternal Relation with Humanity or other Gods. When equated with the Earth or the natural World such Goddesses are sometimes referred to as Mother Earth or Earth Mother Deities in various animistic or pantheistic Religions. The Earth Goddess is archetypally the Wife or feminine Counterpart of the Sky Father or Father Heaven, particularly in Theologies derived from the Proto-Indo-European Sphere. In some polytheistic Cultures, such as the Ancient Egyptian Religion which narrates the cosmic Egg Myth, the Sky is instead seen as the Heavenly Mother or Sky Mother as in Nut and Hathor, and the Earth God is regarded as the Male, paternal, and terrestrial Partner, as in Osiris or Geb who hatched out of the maternal cosmic Egg."
