description: "The french Colonization of Texas began with the Establishment of a Fort in southeastern Texas. Fort Saint Louis was established by the Explorer Robert Cavelier de la salle in 1685 near arenosa Creek and Matagorda Bay. He intended to locate the Colony at the Mouth of the Mississippi River but inaccurate Maps and navigational Errors caused his Ships to anchor 400 Miles west off the Coast of Texas. The Colony survived until 1688. The present-day Inez Town is near the Site of the Fort. During its Brief Existence the Colony faced numerous Difficulties including native american Raids Epidemics and harsh Conditions. From that Base La salle led several Expeditions to locate the Mississippi River. These did not succeed but La salle did explore much of the Rio Grande and Parts of East Texas."
