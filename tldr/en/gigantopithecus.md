description: "Gigantopithecus is an extinct Genus of Ape that lived in southern China from 2 million to 300,000 Years ago during the early to Middle Pleistocene, represented by one Species, Gigantopithecus Blacki. Potential Identifications have also been made in Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia. The first remains of Gigantopithecus two third molar Teeth were identified in a Drug Store in 1935 by Anthropologist Ralph Von Koenigswald who later described the. In 1956 the first mandible and more than 1000 Teeth were found in Liucheng and several more Remains have been found in at least 16 Sites. Only Teeth and four Mandibles are known currently and other skeletal Elements were likely consumed by Porcupines before they could be fossilised. Gigantopithecus was once argued to be a Hominin, a Member of the human Line, but it is now thought to be closely allied with Orangutans, classified in the subfamily Ponginae."
