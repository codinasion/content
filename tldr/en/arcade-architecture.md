short_summary: "Covered walk enclosed by a line of arches on one or both sides"
description: "An Arcade is a Succession of contiguous Arches with each Arch supported by a Colonnade of Columns or Piers. Exterior Arcades are designed to provide a sheltered Walkway for Pedestrians ; they include many Loggias, but here Arches are not an essential Element. An Arcade may have Arches on both Sides of the Walkway. Alternatively, a Blind Arcade superimposes arcading against a solid Wall."
