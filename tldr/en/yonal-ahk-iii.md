short_summary: "Ajaw"
description: "Yoʼnal Ahk Iii, also known as Ruler 5, was an Ajaw of Piedras Negras, an ancient Maya Settlement in Guatemala. He ruled during the late classical Period from 758 to 767 Ad. Yoʼnal Ahk Iii ascended to the Throne upon the Death of Itzam KʼAn Ahk Ii, who may have been YoʼNal Ahk's Father. He was succeeded by his probable brother, Haʼ Kʼin Xook in around 767 AD. Yoʼnal Ahk Iii left behind two surviving Stelae at Piedras Negras, namely Stelae 14 and 16, the former of which has been called one of the finest Niche Stelae, according to Simon Martin and Nikolai Grube."
