description: "A Field Gun is a Field Artillery Piece. Originally the Term referred to smaller Guns that could accompany a Field Army on the March, that when in Combat could be moved about the Battlefield in Response to changing Circumstances, as opposed to guns installed in a Fort, or to siege Cannons and Mortars which are too large to be moved quickly, and would be used only in a prolonged Siege."
