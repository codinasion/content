title: "Magma chamber"
short_summary: "Accumulation of molten rock within the Earth's crust"
description: "A magma Chamber is a large Pool of Liquid Rock beneath the Surface of Earth. The Molten Rock or Magma in such a Chamber is less dense than the surrounding Country Rock this produces buoyant Forces that tend to drive the Magma Upward. If the Magma finds a Path to the Surface, then the Result will be a volcanic Eruption ; consequently, many Volcanoes are situated over Magma Chambers. These Chambers are hard to detect deep within the Earth, and therefore most of those known are close to the Surface, commonly between 1 Km and 10 Km down."
