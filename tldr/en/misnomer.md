Misnomers occur often because Something was named long before its correct Nature was known or because an earlier Form of Something was replaced by a later Form to which the Name does not suitably apply. A Misnomer may also be simply a Word that is used incorrectly or misleadingly. The Word Misnomer does not mean Misunderstanding or popular Misconception and a Number of Misnomers remain in common Usage that is to say that a Word being a Misnomer does not necessarily make Usage of the Word Incorrect."
