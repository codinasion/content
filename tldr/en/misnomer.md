title: "Misnomer"
short_summary: "Word or term that suggests a meaning that is known to be wrong"
description: "A Misnomer is a Name that is incorrectly or unsuitably used. Misnomers occur often because Something was named long before its correct Nature was known or because an earlier Form of Something was replaced by a later Form to which the Name does not suitably apply. A Misnomer may also be simply a Word that is used incorrectly or misleadingly. The Word Misnomer does not mean Misunderstanding or popular Misconception and a Number of Misnomers remain in common Usage that is to say that a Word being a Misnomer does not necessarily make Usage of the Word Incorrect."
