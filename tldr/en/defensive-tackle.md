short_summary: "Position in American football"
description: "A defensive Tackle is a Position in american Football that will typically Line up on the Line of Scrimmage, opposite one of the offensive Guards ; however, he may also Line up opposite one of the Tackles. Defensive Tackles are typically the largest and strongest defensive Player. Depending on a Team's individual defensive Scheme a defensive Tackle may be asked to fill several different Roles. These Roles may include merely holding the Point of Attack by refusing to move or penetrating a certain Gap between offensive Linemen to break up a Play in the Opponent's Backfield. If a defensive Tackle reads a Pass play his primary Responsibility is to pursue the Quarterback or simply knock the Pass down at the Line if it's within Arm's Reach. Other Duties of the defensive Tackle may be to pursue a Screen Pass or Drop into Coverage in a Zone Blitz Scheme. In a traditional 4–3 Defense, there is no nose Tackle. Instead there is a Left and right Defensive Tackle. Some Teams, especially in the National Football League, have a nose Tackle in this Scheme, but most of them do not."
