Common Examples in English Speaking Cultures are barley, Fainites, Crosses, Kings and Exe in the United Kingdom, Pegs and Nibs in New Zealand and Variants of Barley in Australia. In the United States, Terms based on Time-Out have, from the 1950s Onwards, largely supplanted earlier common Terms based on Kings and Exe.
