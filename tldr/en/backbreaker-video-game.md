description: "Backbreaker is an american Football Video Game developed by Naturalmotion and released in north America on June 1 2010 and in Europe on June 25 2010. It uses the Game Engine Euphoria which dynamically determines Animations rather than relying on canned Animations. Backbreaker does not use Teams from the national Football League because electronic Arts has an exclusive License to produce nfl Games for its madden Series. The Game relies on an extensive Logo Editor and Team Builder that was called 'one of its Silver Linings. 'Naturalmotion announced Backbreaker in August 2007, with a targeted Release Date of late 2008. The Game ended up being delayed until mid-2010."
