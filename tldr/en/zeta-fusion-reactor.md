short_summary: "Experimental fusion reactor in the United Kingdom"
description: "Zeta short for Zero Energy Thermonuclear Assembly was a major Experiment in the early History of Fusion Power Research. Based on the Pinch plasma Confinement Technique and built at the atomic Energy Research Establishment in the united Kingdom Zeta was larger and more powerful than any Fusion Machine in the World at that Time. Its Goal was to produce large Numbers of Fusion Reactions although the Reaction was not large enough to produce net Energy."
