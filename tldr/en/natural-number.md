short_summary: "Number used for counting"
description: "In Mathematics, the natural Numbers are the Numbers 1, 2, 3, etc. , possibly including 0 as well. Some Definitions including the standard Iso 80000-2 Start the natural Numbers with 0 which Correspond to the non-negative Integers 0 1 2 3. . . , whereas Others start with 1, corresponding to the positive Integers 1, 2, 3,. . . Texts which exclude zero from the natural Numbers sometimes refer to the natural Numbers together with Zero as whole Numbers while in other Writings this Term is used instead for the Integers. In common Language, particularly in primary School Education, natural Numbers may be called counting Numbers to intuitively exclude the negative Integers and Zero, and also to contrast the Discreteness of counting to the Continuity of Measurement—A Hallmark Characteristic of real Numbers."
