short_summary: "Legendary Vlach ruler of Transylvania around 900 AD"
description: "Gelou according to the Gesta Hungarorum was the Vlach Ruler of Transylvania at the Time of the hungarian Conquest of the carpathian Bas. Although the gesta Hungarorum written after 1150 does not indicate the Enemies of the Conquering Hungarians known from earlier Annals and Chronicles it refers to local Rulers including Gelou who are not mentioned in other primary Sources. As a Result historians Debate whether Gelou was a historical Person or an imaginary Figure created by the unidentified Author of the Gesta Hungarorum. In romanian Historiography based on the Mention of him about 300 Years later by Anonymus Gelou is considered one of three Early-10Th-Century romanian Dukes with Lands in the intra-carpathian Region of Present-Day."
