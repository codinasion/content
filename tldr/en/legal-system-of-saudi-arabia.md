short_summary: "Overview of the legal system of Saudi Arabia"
description: "The legal System of Saudi Arabia is based on Sharia islamic Law derived from the Quran and the Sunnah of islamic Prophet Muhammad. The Sources of Sharia also include Islamic scholarly Consensus developed after Muhammad's Death. Its interpretation by judges in Saudi Arabia is influenced by the medieval texts of the literalist Hanbali school of Fiqh. In the muslim World Sharia has been adopted in uncodified Form by Saudi Arabia. This and the Absence of judicial Precedent have resulted in considerable Uncertainty over the Scope and Content of the Country's Laws. In 2010 the Government announced its Intention to codify Sharia and in 2018 the saudi Government published a Sourcebook of the sharia legal Principles and Precedents. Sharia has also been supplemented by Regulations issued by royal Decree covering modern Issues such as intellectual Property and corporate Law. Nevertheless, Sharia remains the primary Source of Law, especially in Areas such as criminal, Family, commercial and Contract Law, and the Qur'An and the Sunnah are declared to be the Country's Constitution. In the Areas of Land and Energy Law the extensive proprietorial Rights of the Saudi State Constitute a significant Feature."
