The Royal Fifth was first introduced in medieval muslim States from Interpretations of the Qur'An though the Extent to which it applied was debated between Schools of Islam. During the Age of Exploration, christian Iberian Kingdoms and their overseas Colonial Empires also instituted the Tax, though to encourage Exploration, some Monarchs allowed Colonists to keep some or all of the Fifth."
