short_summary: "Music genre"
description: "Reggae is a Music Genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1960S. The Term also refers to the modern popular Music of Jamaica and its Diaspora. A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals, 'do the Reggay', was the first popular Song to use the Word Reggae, effectively naming the Genre and introducing it to a global Audience. Although often used in a broad Sense to refer to most Types of popular jamaican Dance Music the Term reggae more properly denotes a particular Music Style that was strongly influenced by traditional Mento as well as by american Jazz and Rhythm and Blues and evolved from the earlier Genres. Reggae generally relates to News social Gossip and political Commentary. It is instantly recognizable from the Counterpoint between the Bass and Drum Downbeat and the Offbeat rhythm Section. The immediate Origins of Reggae were in Ska and Rocksteady ; from the Latter, Reggae took over the Use of the Bass as a Percussion Instrument."
