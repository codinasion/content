short_summary: "Unprotected cruiser of the German Imperial Navy"
description: "Sms Gefion was an unprotected Cruiser of the german Kaiserliche marine the last Ship of this Type built in Germany. She was laid down in March 1892, launched in March 1893, and completed in June 1895 after lengthy Trials and Repairs. The Cruiser was named after the earlier sail Frigate Gefion named after the Goddess Gefjon of norse Mythology. Intended for Service in the german Colonial Empire and as a Fleet Scout, Gefion was armed with a main Battery of ten 10. 5-centimeter guns, had a top speed in excess of 19. 5 Knots, and could steam for 3,500 nautical Miles, the longest Range of any german Warship at the Time. However the Conflicting Requirements necessary for a Fleet Scout and an overseas Cruiser produced an unsuccessful Design and Gefion was quickly replaced by the newer gazelle Class of light Cruisers in both Roles."
