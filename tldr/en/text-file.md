short_summary: "Computer file containing plain text"
description: "A Text File is a Kind of Computer File structured as a Sequence of Lines of electronic Text. A Text File exists as Data stored within a Computer File System. In operating Systems such as Cpm and Dos where the Operating System does not keep Track of File Size in bytes the End of a Text File is marked by placing a special Character known as an end-of-file Marker as Padding after the last Line in a. On modern operating Systems such as microsoft Windows and unix-like Systems text Files do not contain a special Character as file Systems on those operating Systems maintain file Sizes in Bytes. Most text Files need to have end-of-line Delimiters, which are done in a few different Ways depending on Operating System. Some Operating Systems that have record-orientated file Systems may not use new Line Delimiters and primarily store text Files with Lines separated as fixed or variable Length Records."
