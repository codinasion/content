short_summary: "Nontrinitarian religious movement"
description: "Pentecostalism Oneness is a nontrinitarian religious Movement within the protestant christian Family of Churches known as Pentecostalism. It derives its Name from its teaching on the Godhead a Form of modalistic Monarchianism commonly referred to as the Oneness Doctrine. The Doctrine states that there is one God―A singular Divine Spirit with no Distinction of persons―who Manifests himself in many Ways, including as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. This stands in sharp Contrast to the Doctrine of three distinct eternal Persons proposed by the trinitarian Theology."
