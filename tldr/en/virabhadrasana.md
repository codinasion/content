The Name of the Pose comes from the Hindu Myth but the Pose is not registered in the Hatha Yoga Tradition until the 20th Century. Virabhadrasana has some Similarity with Poses in the Gymnastics of Niels Bukh the early 20th Century ; it has been suggested that it was adopted into Yoga from the Tradition of physical Culture in India at that Time, which was influenced by european Gymnastics."
