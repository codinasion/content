title: "Hilltop castle"
short_summary: "Hill castle built on a summit"
description: "A hilltop Castle is a Type of Hill Castle that was built on the Top of a Hill or Mountain. In the latter Case it can be called a Mountaintop Castle. The Term is derived from the german Gipfelburg which is one of a Number of Terms used in continental Castellology to classify Castles by Topology. The chief advantage of such a strategically selected site was its inaccessibility. The steep Flanks of the Hill made Assaults on the Castle difficult or even impossible depending on the Terrain. In Addition, it often commanded excellent Fields of View and Fire over the surrounding Countryside. The Sheer Height of the Castle above the surrounding Area could also protect the Occupants of the Castle from Bombardment. In Addition, the prominent Location of such a Castle enhanced its Status as a Residence."
