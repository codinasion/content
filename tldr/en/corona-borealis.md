title: "Corona Borealis"
short_summary: "Constellation in the northern celestial hemisphere"
description: "Corona Borealis is a small Constellation in the northern Celestial Hemisphere. It is one of the 48 Constellations listed by the 2nd-century Astronomer Ptolemy and remains one of 88 modern Constellations. Its brightest Stars form a semicircular Arc. Its Latin Name, inspired by its Shape, means 'northern Crown'. In classical Mythology Corona Borealis generally represented the Crown given to the Cretan Princess Ariadne by the God Dionysus and placed in the Heavens. Other Cultures likened the Pattern to a Circle of Elders, an Eagle's nest, a Bear's Den or a Smokehole. Ptolemy also listed a southern Counterpart, Corona Australis, with a similar Pattern."
