description: "Neptunium is a chemical Element that has a Symbol Np and a 93 atomic Number. The first transuranic Element is a radioactive Actinide Metal Neptunium. Its position in the periodic table just after uranium, named after the planet Uranus, led to it being named after Neptune, the next planet beyond Uranus. A Neptunium Atom has 93 Protons and 93 Electrons of which seven are Electrons of Valence. Neptunium metal is silvery and tarnishes when exposed to air. The Element occurs in three Allotropic Forms and it normally exhibits five Oxidation States from 3 to 7. Like all Actinides, it is radioactive, poisonous, pyrophoric, and capable of accumulating in Bones, which makes the Handling of Neptunium dangerous."
