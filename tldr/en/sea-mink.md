short_summary: "Extinct species of mustelid mammal from eastern North America"
description: "The Sea Mink is a recently extinct Species of Mink that lived along the eastern Coast of north America around the Gulf of Maine on the new England Coast. It was most closely related to the american Mink with continuing Debate about whether or not the Sea Mink should be considered a Subspecies of the american Mink or a. The main Argument for a separate Species Designation is the Size Difference between the two Minks but other Distinctions such as its Redder Fur have been made. The only Known Remains are bone Fragments unearthed in the native american Shell Middens. Its actual Size is speculative, based largely on Tooth Remains."
