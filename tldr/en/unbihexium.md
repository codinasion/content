short_summary: "Chemical element, symbol Ubh and atomic number 126"
description: "Unbihexium, also known as element 126 or Eka-Plutonium, is a hypothetical Chemical Element ; it has atomic Number 126 and placeholder Symbol Ubh. Unbihexium and Ubh are the temporary Iupac Name and Symbol, respectively, until the Element is discovered, confirmed, and a permanent Name is decided upon. In the Periodic Table, Unbihexium is expected to be a g-block Superactinide and the eighth Element in the 8th Period. Unbihexium has attracted Attention among nuclear Physicists, especially in early Predictions targeting Properties of superheavy Elements, for 126 may be a magic Number of Protons near the Center of an Island of Stability, leading to longer Half-Lives, especially for 310ubh or 354ubh which may also have magic Numbers of Neutrons."
