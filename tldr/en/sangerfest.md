short_summary: "Germanic musical competitions"
description: "Sängerfest, also Sängerbund-Fest, Sängerfeste, or Saengerfest, meaning Singer Festival, is a Competition of Sängerbunds, or Singer Groups, with Prizes for the best Group or Groups. Such public Events are also known as Liederfest or Song Festival. Some Participants are in the Hundreds and Thousands and the fest is usually accompanied by a Parade and other Celebratory Activities. The Sngerfest is most associated with germanic Culture. Its Origins can be traced back to 19th Century Europe. Swiss Composer Hans Georg Nägeli and Educator Carl Friedrich Zelter, both Protégés of Swiss Educator Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi, established Sängerbunds to help foster social Change throughout Germany and Prussia. University Students began to use the Art Form as an Avenue for political Statements. As the Concept of Sngerfest gained Popularity and Spread around the World it was adopted for spiritual Worship Services by christian Churches. European Immigrants brought the Tradition to the north american Continent in a non-political Form. In the early Part of the 20th Century sngerfest Celebrations attracted Devotees in the Tens of Thousands and included some Presidents among their Audiences. Sngerbunds are still active in Europe and in american Communities with germanic Ancestry."
