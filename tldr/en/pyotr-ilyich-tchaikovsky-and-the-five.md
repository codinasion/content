description: "In mid-19th Century Russia Pyotr ilyich Tchaikovsky and a Group of Composers known as the five had differing Views as to whether russian classical Music should follow western or native Practices. Tchaikovsky wanted to write professional Compositions of such Quality that they would stand up to western Scrutiny and therefore transcend national Barriers yet remain distinctively russian in Melody Rhythm and other compositional Characteristics. The five Composers mily balakirev Alexander Borodin Csar Cui modest Mussorgsky and nikolai rimsky-korsakov Sought to produce a specifically russian Type of Art Music rather than one that imitated older european Music. While Tchaikovsky himself used Folk Songs in some of his Works for the most Part he tried to follow western Practices of Composition particularly in Terms of Tonality and tonal Progression. Unlike tchaikovsky None of the five were not academically trained in Composition in Fact their Leader Balakirev considered Academicism a Threat to the musical Imagination. Along with critic Vladimir Stasov, who supported the Five, Balakirev attacked relentlessly both the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, from which Tchaikovsky had graduated, and its Founder Anton Rubinstein, orally and in Print."
