short_summary: "Early style of rock and roll music"
description: "Rockabilly is an early style of rock and roll music. It dates back to the early 1950s in the United States, especially the South. As a Genre it mixes the Sound of western musical Styles such as Country with that of Rhythm and Blues leading to what is considered classic Rock and Roll. The Term 'rockabilly' itself is a Portmanteau of 'Rock' and 'hillbilly' ; the Latter is a Reference to Country Music that contributed strongly to the Style. Other important Influences on rockabilly include western swing boogie-woogie Jump Blues and electric Blues."
