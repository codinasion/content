title: "Reinforced concrete"
short_summary: "Concrete with rebar"
description: "Reinforced Concrete also called Ferroconcrete is a composite Material in which the relatively low tensile Strength and Ductility of Concrete is compensated by the Inclusion of Reinforcement having higher tensile Strength or Duct. The Reinforcement is usually though not necessarily Steel Bars and is usually passively embedded in the Concrete before it sets. However, Post-Tensioning is also employed as a Technique to reinforce the Concrete. In Terms of the Amount used annually it is one of the most common Engineering Materials. In Corrosion Engineering Terms when the Structure is properly designed the Alkalinity of the concrete protects the Steel Rebar from Corrosion."
