short_summary: "Former U.S. college athletic conference"
description: "The metropolitan Collegiate athletic Conference commonly known as the Metro Conference was an ncaa Division I Athletics Conference so named because its six Charter Members were all in urban metropolitan Areas though its later Members did not follow this Pattern. The Conference was centered in the upper South with some Strength in the deep South. The Conference never sponsored Football although most of its Members had division-i-a Football Programs throughout its History. It merged with the great midwest Conference in 1995 to form the Conference Usa. The Merger was mainly driven by Football as several Metro Conference Members were successfully lured to larger Conferences sponsoring the Sport."
