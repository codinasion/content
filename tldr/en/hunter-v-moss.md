short_summary: "1993 English trusts law case"
description: "Hunter V Moss 1 Wlr 452 is a Court of Appeal Case on Trust Law in England with Respect to the Certainty of subject Matter needed to form a Trust. Moss promised hunter 50 Shares in his Company as Part of a Contract but failed to provide them. Hunter filed for them a Claim against Moss arguing that Moss's Promise created a Trust over the 50 Shares. The Constitution of Trusts normally requires that Trust Property be segregated from non-trust Property for the Trust to be valid, as in Re London Wine Co Ltd. On this Occasion, however, both Colin Rimer in the high Court of Justice and Dillon, Mann and Hirst Ljj in the Court of Appeal felt that, because this Case dealt with intangible rather than tangible Property, this Rule did not have to be applied. Because all the Shares were identical it did n't matter that they were not segregated and the Trust was valid. The Decision was applied in the Case of Harvard Securities which created a Rule that Segregation is not always necessary when the Trust Concerns identical intangible Assets."
