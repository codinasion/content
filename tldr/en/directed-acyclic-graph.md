title: "Directed acyclic graph"
short_summary: "Directed graph with no directed cycles"
description: "A directed acyclic Graph is a directed Graph with no directed Cycles particularly in Mathematics graph Theory and Computer Science. It consists of Vertices and Edges with each Edge directed from one Vertex to another such that following these Directions will never form a closed Loop. A directed Graph is a Dag if and only if it can be topologically ordered by arranging Vertices as a linear ordering consistent with all Edge Directions. Dags have numerous scientific and computational Applications ranging from Biology to Information Science to Computation."
