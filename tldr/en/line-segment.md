title: "Line segment"
short_summary: "Part of a line that is bounded by two distinct end points; line with two endpoints"
description: "In Geometry a Line Segment is a Part of a straight Line that is bound by two distinct End Points and Contains every Point on the Line between its Endpoints. It is a special Case of an Arc with zero Curvature. The Length of a Segment of a Line is given by the euclidean Distance between its Endpoints. A closed Line Segment includes both Endpoints while an open Line Segment excludes both Endpoints a half-open Line Segment contains exactly one Endpoint. In Geometry a Segment of a Line is often denoted using an Overline above the Symbols for the two Endpoints such as Ab."
