short_summary: "Protected cruiser class of the Italian Royal Navy"
description: "The Nino Bixio Class was a Pair of protected Cruisers built in the 1910s for italian Regia Marina. Between 1911 and 1914 the two Ships nino Bixio and Marsala were built in Castellammare. They were intended to serve as Scouts for the main italian Fleet and required high top Speed as such. They were overweight as Built, which prevented them from reaching their intended Maximum Speed. They were a Disappointment in Service, especially compared to the Earlier—And Faster—Cruiser Quarto, which cut their Careers short."
