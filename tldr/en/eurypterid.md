The Group is likely to have appeared first either in the early ordovician or late cambrian Period. With approximately 250 Species, the Eurypterida is the most diverse Paleozoic Chelicerate Order. Following their Appearance during the ordovician Eurypterids became major Components of marine Fauna during the Silurian from which the Majority of eurypterid Species have been described. The silurian Genus Eurypterus Accounts for more than 90 of all known Eurypterid Specimens. Though the Group continued to diversify during the subsequent devonian Period the Eurypterids were heavily affected by the late devonian Extinction Event. They declined in Numbers and Diversity until they became extinct during the permian triassic Extinction Event 251. 9Â million years ago."
