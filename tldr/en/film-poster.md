Studios often print multiple Posters that vary in Size and Content for various domestic and international Markets. They normally contain an Image with Text. Present-day Posters often feature printed Likenesses of the major Actors. Before the 1980s Illustrations were much more common instead of Photographs. The Text on Film Posters usually contains the Film Title in large Letters and sometimes the Names of the main Actors. It may also include a Tagline, the Name of the Director, Names of Characters, the Release Date, and other Pertinent Details to inform prospective Viewers about the Film."
