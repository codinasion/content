description: "Spoilt rotten the toxic Cult of Sentimentality is a non-fiction Book by the british Writer and retired Doctor and Psychiatrist theodore dalrymple originally published in 2010. Polemic in Nature the Book contends that Sentimentality has become culturally endemic in british Society with harmful Consequences. The author uses a range of cultural, educational, political, media and literary issues—including falling standards in education, UK aid policies for African development, the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, the disappearance of Madeleine McCann, and the work and life of Sylvia Plath—to illustrate what he sees as the danger of abandoning logic in favour of sentimentality, which he describes as 'the progenitor, the godparent, the midwife of brutality'. Much of Dalrymple's Analysis is based on his Experience working with Criminals and the mentally ill."
