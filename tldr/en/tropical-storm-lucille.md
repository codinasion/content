description: "Tropical Storm Lucille was the first tropical cyclone to have its name retired in the Western Pacific basin. Lucille was diagnosed in may 25 1960 to the East of the Philippines as a weak tropical Depression. The System failed to develop tracking northwestward and Warnings were discontinued on may 27. At the same time, a second system began organizing along the west coast of Luzon. The two Systems merged in the Philippines between may 28 and 29. Now tracking northeast the System re-intensified on may 30 and was a tropical Storm. Lucille reached Peak Intensity later that Day with Winds of 85 Kmh. As it accelerated over open Waters the System brushed the Islands of iwo Jima and Chichi-Jima before transitioning on 1 June into an extratropical Cyclone. The Remnants of Lucille were last identified near the international Date Line on June 4."
