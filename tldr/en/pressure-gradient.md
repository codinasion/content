title: "Pressure gradient"
short_summary: "Space rate of variation of pressure in a given direction"
description: "In atmospheric Science the Pressure Gradient is a physical Quantity that describes in which Direction and at what Rate the Pressure increases the most rapidly around a specific Location. The Pressure Gradient is a dimensioned Quantity expressed in Pascals per Metre. Mathematically it is the Gradient of Pressure as a Function of Position. The negative Gradient of Pressure is known as Force Density."
