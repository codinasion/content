A maximum Modified Mercalli intensity of VII was evaluated based on damage. It had a strike-slip focal Mechanism which was unusual as the Source Structure was a Thrust Fault. It was Part of a Sequence of Earthquakes along the 400-kilometer Kuh Banan Fault. Between 584 and 665 People perished while a further 500–1,000 were injured ; Thousands were also made Homeless. The Death Toll from the Earthquake was considered moderate due to the sparsely populated Area it affected. Preceded by Foreshocks the Month before, many Residents became wary of a larger Earthquake and took Refuge outside their Homes, contributing to the moderate Death Toll. However, there were None immediately before the Mainshock so many were still in their Homes when it struck. Aftershocks were felt for several Months, some causing additional Damage."
