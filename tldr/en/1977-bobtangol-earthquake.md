The Death Toll from the Earthquake was considered moderate due to the sparsely populated Area it affected. Preceded by Foreshocks the Month before, many Residents became wary of a larger Earthquake and took Refuge outside their Homes, contributing to the moderate Death Toll. However, there were None immediately before the Mainshock so many were still in their Homes when it struck. Aftershocks were felt for several Months, some causing additional Damage."
