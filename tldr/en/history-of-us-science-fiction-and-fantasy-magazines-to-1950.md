short_summary: "Science-fiction and fantasy magazine history"
description: "In the 1920s Science Fiction and fantasy Magazines began to be published in the united States. Stories with Science-Fiction Themes had been appearing for Decades in Pulp Magazines such as Argosy, but there were no Magazines that specialized in a single Genre until 1915, when Street & Smith, one of the major Pulp Publishers, brought out Detective Story Magazine. The first Magazine focused exclusively on Fantasy and Horror was weird Tales which was launched in 1923 and established itself over the next two Decades as the leading weird Fiction Magazine. P. Lovecraft, Clark Ashton Smith and Robert E. Howard became regular Contributors. In 1926 Weird Tales was joined by Amazing Stories, published by Hugo Gernsback ; Amazing printed only science Fiction, and no Fantasy. Gernsback included a Column in amazing Stories which led to the Creation of organized Science-Fiction Fandom as Fans contacted each other using the Addresses published with the Letters. Gernsback wanted his fictional Work to be scientifically accurate educational as well as entertaining but found it difficult to obtain Stories that met his Goals he published the Moon Pool by abraham Merritt in 1927 despite it being completely unscientific. In 1929 Gernsback lost Control of amazing Stories but started several new Magazines. Wonder Stories one of Gernsback's Titles was edited by david Lasser who worked to improve the Quality of the Fiction he received. Another early Competitor was astounding Stories of Super-Science which appeared in 1930 edited by Harry Bates but Bates printed only the most basic Adventure Stories with minimal scientific Content and little of the Material from his Era is now remembered."
