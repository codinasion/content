short_summary: "Type of signal processing filter"
description: "A mechanical Filter is a signal Processing Filter usually used in Place of an electronic Filter on Radio Frequencies. Its Purpose is the same as that of a normal electronic Filter to pass a Range of signal Frequencies but to block Others. The Filter operates on mechanical Vibrations which are Analogues of the electrical Signal. At the Input and Output of the Filter, Transducers convert the electrical Signal into, and then back from, these mechanical Vibrations."
