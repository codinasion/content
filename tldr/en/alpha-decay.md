title: "Alpha decay"
short_summary: "Type of radioactive decay"
description: "Alpha decay or α-decay is a type of radioactive decay in which an atomic nucleus emits an alpha particle and thereby transforms or 'decays' into a different atomic nucleus, with a mass number that is reduced by four and an atomic number that is reduced by two. An alpha Particle is identical to the Nucleus of a helium-4 Atom which consists of two Protons and two Neutrons. It has a Charge of +2 E and a Mass of 4 Da. For Example uranium-238 Decays into thorium-234."
