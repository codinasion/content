title: "Palestinian enclaves"
short_summary: "Fragmentation of the West Bank over time"
description: "The Palestinian enclaves are areas in the West Bank designated for Palestinians under a variety of unsuccessful U. S. And israeli-led Proposals to end the israeliâ€“palestinian Conflict. The Enclaves are often compared to the nominally self-governing black Homelands created in south Africa as Part of Apartheid and are therefore referred to as Bantustans. They have been referred to figuratively as the Palestinian archipelago, among other terms. In 2024 Israel's de facto Status is that it controls all of the Area outside these Enclaves."
