title: "Catchphrase"
short_summary: "Phrase or expression recognized by its repeated utterance"
description: "A Catchphrase is a Phrase or Expression recognized by its repeated Utterance. Such Phrases often originate in popular Culture and the Arts and typically spread through Word of Mouth and a Variety of Mass Media. Some become the de facto or literal 'Trademark' or 'Signature' of the Person or Character with whom they originated, and can be instrumental in the Typecasting of a particular Actor. Catchphrases are often humorous, but are never long enough or structured enough to be Jokes in themselves. However a Catchphrase can be the Punchline of a Joke or a Reminder of a previous Joke."
