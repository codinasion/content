short_summary: "NBA professional basketball team season"
description: "The Toronto Raptors 2006–07 season was the twelfth National Basketball Association season for the Toronto Raptors basketball franchise. Following a poor 200506 Season general Manager Bryan Colangelo greatly revamped the Team Roster during the Pre-Season but continued to build the Team around all-star Chris Bosh. Despite a sluggish Start the Season of 200607 became a Turning Point for Toronto. The Raptors captured their first Division Title, finished third in the Eastern Conference, made the Playoffs for the first Time in five Years, equalled their best ever regular Season Record of the 2000–01 Team, and secured Home Court Advantage for the first Time in franchise History. However the Raptors faced the new Jersey Nets in the first Round of the Playoffs and were defeated four Games to two. At the End of the regular Season Sam Mitchell and Colangelo were named respectively nba Coach of the Year and nba Executive of the Year. The Raptors also changed their Colour Scheme which is still in Use Today."
