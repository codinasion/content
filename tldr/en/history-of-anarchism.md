short_summary: "History of the ambiguous term and movement of anarchism"
description: "The History of Anarchism is largely ambiguous due to the Ambiguity of Anarchism itself. Scholars find it hard to define or agree on what Anarchism means which makes the Outline of its History difficult. There are a Number of Viewpoints on Anarchism and its History. Some have felt that Anarchism is a distinct well-defined Movement in the 19th and 20th Centuries while Others identify anarchist Traits long before first Civilisations existed."
