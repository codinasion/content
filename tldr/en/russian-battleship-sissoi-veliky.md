description: "Sissoi Veliky was a Battleship built in the 1890s for the imperial russian Navy. The Ship's Construction was marred by organizational logistical and Engineering Problems and dragged for more than five Years. She was commissioned in october 1896 with an appalling Number of Design and Construction Faults and only a few of them were repaired during her Lifetime. Immediately after Sea Trials sissoi Veliky sailed to the Mediterranean to enforce the naval Blockade of Crete during the greco-turkish War. She suffered a devastating Explosion on March 15 1897 which killed 21 Men. After nine Months of Repairs on Toulon docks the Ship sailed to the far east to reinforce Russia's Presence there. In the Summer of 1900 Sissoi Veliky supported the international Campaign against the boxer Rebellion in China. Sailors from sissoi Veliky and the Battleship Navarin participated in Beijing's Defense of the international Legations for more than two Months."
