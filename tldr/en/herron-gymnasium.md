short_summary: "Former gymnasium at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, USA"
description: "Herron Gymnasium was a Gymnasium and Classroom Building on the Miami University Campus in Oxford Ohio. Known later as Van voorhis Hall it was listed in the november 1979 national Register of historic Places. Originally conceived in 1893, it was constructed in 1897 and named for John W. Herron, a Miami Alumnus and Cincinnati Judge. It was Miami University's first Gymnasium, and would serve as the main recreational Center until the Construction of Withrow Court in 1932, which led Herron to become a Women's Gym. Except for an Interlude during World War Ii when it served as a Navy Barracks, it served as a Women's Gym until the Construction of 'New Herron' in 1962. In the late 20th Century its Use diminished to Afrotc and Men's intramural Sports, and the Gymnasium was demolished in 1986 and replaced with a Parking Lot."
