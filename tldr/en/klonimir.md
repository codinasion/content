short_summary: "9th-century Serbian prince"
description: "Klonimir was a serbian Prince of the Vlastimirovi Dynasty and a Presumptator of the Throne of the serbian. His Father and uncle Co-Princes Strojimir and Gojnik had been exiled with their Families to Bulgaria after their eldest Brother Mutimir had taken them out of the serbian Thron. Klonimir married a bulgarian Noblewoman chosen by khan Boris I himself. She later gave Birth to a Son named Aslav. The Descendants of the three Vlastimirović Branches continued the Feud over the Serbian Throne which spanned over the Century, and Klonimir returned to Serbia in ca. He attempted to take the Country from his Cousin Petar who had ruled since 891. He managed to take over the serbian City of Destinikon but the much more powerful Petar defeated him and it is presumed that Klonimir died in Battle. His Son Časlav later became the most powerful of the Vlastimirović Dynasty, as Prince of Serbia from 927 to 960, unifying several Tribes in the Region."
