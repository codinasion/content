description: "The Music Machine was an american Rock Band formed in 1966 in los Angeles California. The Band fronted by Chief Songwriter and vocalist Sean Bonniwell cultivated a characteristically dark and rebellious Image reflecting in an untamed musical Approach. Sometimes it made Use of distorted Guitar Lines and hallucinogenic Organ Parts, punctuated by Bonniwell's distinctively throaty Vocals. Although they managed to attain national Chart Success only briefly with two Singles the Music Machine is Today considered by many Critics to be one of the groundbreaking Acts of the 1960S. Their Style is now recognized as a pioneering Force in Proto-Punk yet within a relatively short Period they began to employ more complex lyrical and instrumental Arrangements that went beyond the typical Garage Band Format."
