Sometimes it made Use of distorted Guitar Lines and hallucinogenic Organ Parts, punctuated by Bonniwell's distinctively throaty Vocals. Although they managed to attain national Chart Success only briefly with two Singles the Music Machine is Today considered by many Critics to be one of the groundbreaking Acts of the 1960S.
