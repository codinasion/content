Although pioneering the Use of Turbojet Power as the first naval Fighter with an Afterburner and composite Material Construction the Aircraft proved to be underpowered and was considered unsuitable for Combat. None were ever given to operational Squadrons and they were relegated to Development Training and testing Roles before they were withdrawn from Service in 1950."
