short_summary: "Measurement of distance from river mouth"
description: "A River Mile is a Measure of Distance along a River from its Mouth in Miles. River Mile Numbers begin at zero and increase further Upstream. The corresponding metric Unit is a River Kilometer using Kilometers. They are analogous to Vehicle Roadway Mile Markers, except that River Miles are rarely marked on the physical River ; instead they are marked on Navigation Charts, and topographic Maps. Riverfront Properties are sometimes partially legally described by their River Mile."
