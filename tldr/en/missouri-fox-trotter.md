short_summary: "American horse breed"
description: "The Missouri Fox Trotter is a Horse Breed that originated in the State of Missouri in the United States. It was developed in the Ozark Mountains by Settlers in the early 19th Century, and quickly developed into a gaited Breed appreciated for its Stock Horse Abilities, Stamina and smooth Gaits. It performs an ambling Gait known as the 'fox Trot', a four-beat broken diagonal Gait in which the front Foot of the diagonal Pair lands before the Hind, eliminating the Moment of Suspension and increasing Smoothness. The main Breed Registry was created in 1948 and has registered almost 100000 Horses as of 2012. In 1992 a european Registry was started and recognizes around 600 Fox Trotters living in Europe as of 2009. In 2006, a smaller Registry, focused on the Preservation of the original, historic Type, was begun in the United States. The Fox Trotter is a mid-sized muscular Breed that is used mainly for Trail Riding and Ranch Work."
