title: "Fibonacci nim"
short_summary: "Game of taking coins from a pile"
description: "Fibonacci Nim is a mathematical Subtraction Game, a Variant of the Game of Nim. Players alternate removing Coins from a Pile on each Move taking at least twice as many Coins as the previous Move and Winning by taking the last Coin. The Fibonacci Numbers feature heavily in its Analysis ; in particular, the first Player can win if and only if the starting Number of Coins is not a Fibonacci Number. A complete Strategy is known for best Play in Games with a single Pile of Counters but not for Variations of the Game with multiple Piles."
