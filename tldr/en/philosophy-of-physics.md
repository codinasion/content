description: "Philosophy of Physics Deals with conceptual and interpretational Questions in modern Physics many of which overlap with Research done by certain Kinds of theoretical Physicists. Philosophy of Physics can be broadly divided into three Areas Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics primarily about Issues regarding how to formulate an adequate Response to the Measurement Problem and understand what the Theory says about Reality. What is a Relationship between Time and Space? Is simultaneity conventional or only relative? Is temporal asymmetry purely reducible to thermodynamic asymmetry? The Relation between various physical Theories such as Thermodynamics and statistical Mechanics. This overlaps with the Question of scientific Reduction."
