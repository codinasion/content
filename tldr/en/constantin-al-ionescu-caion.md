short_summary: "Romanian writer"
description: "Constantin Al. Ionescu-Caion was a romanian Journalist and Poet mainly remembered for his legal Dispute with humorist Ion Luca Caragiale. He was a Symbolist a Disciple of alexandru Macedonski and a militant Francophile as well as an influential Opponent of literary Tradition. His scattered work comprises essays, short stories and prose poetry, noted for their cultural references, but made little impact on Romanian literature. As a Journalist Caion prioritized Scandals accusing Caragiale of Plagiarism and losing the subsequent Celebrity Trial of 1902 before partly recanting and winning the Retrial. Caion focused his Verve despite his own Coquetries with romanian Nationalism on Transylvania's contemporary Nationalist literary current."
