short_summary: "Species of plant of Western Australia"
description: "Banksia Sessilis commonly known as Parrot Bush is a Species of Shrub or Tree in the Plant Genus Banksia of the Proteaceae Family. It was known as Dryandra Sessilis until 2007 when the Genus Dryandra was sunk into Banksia. The noongar People know the Plant as Budjan or Butyak. Widespread throughout southwest western Australia it is found in sandy Soils over laterite or limestone often as an understorey Plant in open Forest Woodland or Shrubland. It is designated as a Shrub or small Tree up to 6 Meters in Height with prickly Dark green Leaves and dome-shaped cream-yellow Flower Heads. Flowering from Winter through to late Spring, it provides a key Source of food—both the Nectar and the Insects it attracts—for Honeyeaters in the Cooler Months, and Species Diversity is reduced in Areas where there is little or no Parrot Bush occurring. Several Species of Honeyeater some Species of native Bee and the european Honey Bee Seek and consume Nectar while the long-billed black Cockatoo and the australian Ringneck eat the Seeds. The Life Cycle of Banksia Sessilis is adapted to typical Bushfires. Killed by Fire and Regenerating by Seed Afterwards, each Shrub generally produces many Flowerheads and a massive Amount of Seed. It can recolonise disturbed areas, and may grow in thickets."
