short_summary: "Events in J. R. R. Tolkien's fictional universe"
description: "In J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium, the Elves or Quendi are a sundered people. They awoke at Cuiviénen on the Continent of Middle-Earth, where they were divided into three Tribes: Minyar, Tatyar and Nelyar. After some time, they were summoned by Oromë to live with the Valar in Valinor, on Aman. The Summoning and the great Journey that followed split the Elves in two Groups that were never reunited fully."
