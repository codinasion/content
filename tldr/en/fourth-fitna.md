short_summary: "Abbasid-era Muslim civil war (811–819)"
description: "The fourth Fitna or great abbasid civil War resulted from the Conflict between Brothers al-amin and al-ma'mun over Succession of the Abbasid King to the. Their Father, Caliph Harun Al-Rashid, had named al-amin as the first Successor, but had also named Al-Ma'Mun as the second, with Khurasan granted to him as an Appanage. Later a third Son Al-Qasim was appointed as the third Successor. After Harun died in 809, al-Amin succeeded him in Baghdad. Encouraged by the Baghdad Court, al-amin began trying to subvert the autonomous Status of Khurasan, and Al-Qasim was quickly sidelined. In Response al-ma'mun sought the Support of the khurasan provincial Lites and made Moves to assert his own Autonomy. As the Rift between the two Brothers and their respective Camps grew al-amin declared his own Son Musa as his Heir and assembled a large Army. In 811 Al-Amin's Troops marched against Khurasan but general Tahir Ibn Husayn of al-ma'mun defeated them in the Battle of Ray and then invaded Iraq and besieged Bag. After a Year Al-Amin was executed and al-ma'mun became caliph."
