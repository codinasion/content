title: "Chinese classifier"
short_summary: "Measure words in Chinese"
description: "The modern chinese Varieties regularly use what are called Classifiers or Measure Words. Classifiers are used when a Noun is either qualified with a numeral or demonstrative. In the chinese Equivalent of a Phrase such as 'three Books' or 'that Person', it is normally necessary to insert an appropriate Classifier between the numeral/demonstrative and the Noun. For Example, in Standard Mandarin, the first of these Phrases would be 三本书 sān Běn Shū, where Sān means'three', Shū Means'books', and Běn is the required Classifier. No Classifier is needed when a noun stands alone without a Determiner. There are also various other Uses of Classifiers: for Example, when placed after a Noun rather than before it, or when repeated, a Classifier signifies a plural or indefinite Quantity."
