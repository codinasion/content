description: "A Knockout or sudden Death Tournament is a Type of Elimination Tournament where the Loser of each Match-Up is immediately eliminated from the Tournament. Each Winner will play another in the next Round, until the final Match-Up, whose Winner becomes the tournament Champion. Each Match-Up may be a single Match or several for Example two-legged Ties in european Sports or Best-Of-Series in north american pro Sport. Defeated Competitors may play no longer after losing or may participate in Consolation or Classification Matches against other Losers to determine the lower final Rankings such as a third Place Playoff between losing Semi-Finalists.
