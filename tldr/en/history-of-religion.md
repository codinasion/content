description: "The History of Religion Refers to the written Record of human religious Feelings, Thoughts, and Ideas. This Period of religious History began with the Invention of the writing about 5200 Years ago. The Prehistory of Religion involves the Study of Religions that existed prior to the Advent of written Records. One can also study comparative religious Chronology by using a religious Timeline. Writing played a major Role in standardizing religious texts Regardless of Time or Place and making it easier to remember Prayers and Divine Rules."
