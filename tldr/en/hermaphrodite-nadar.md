short_summary: "1860 series of photographs by Nadar"
description: "Hermaphrodite is a Series of Photographs of a young Intersex Person who had a Male Body build and Stature and may have been assigned female or self-identified as female taken by french Photographer Nadar in 1860. Possibly commissioned by Armand Trousseau the nine Photographs have been described as probably the first medical Photograph-Illustrations of a Patient with Intersex Genitalia. They were originally restricted for scientific Purposes and Nadar did not publish them. Over the next several Decades further Photographs of Intersex Subjects followed although there is no Evidence that the Photographers knew of Nadar's Work."
