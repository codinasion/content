short_summary: "Harbour in Bristol, England"
description: "Bristol Harbour is the Harbour in the City of Bristol, England. The Area of the Harbour is 70 Acres. It is the former natural River Avon which flows through the City but was made into its current Form in 1809 when the Tide was prevented from going out permanently. A tidal By-Pass was dug for 2 Miles through the Fields of Bedminster for the River, known as the 'River Avon New Cut', 'New Cut', or simply 'the Cut'. It is often called the Floating Harbour as the Water Level remains constant and it is not affected by the State of the Tide on the River in the Avon Gorge, the New Cut or the natural River Southeast of Temple Meads to its Source."
