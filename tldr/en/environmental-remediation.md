title: "Environmental remediation"
short_summary: "Removal of pollution from soil, groundwater etc."
description: "Environmental Remediation is the Cleanup of hazardous Substances dealing with the Removal Treatment and Containment of Pollution or Contaminants from environmental Media such as Soil Groundwater Sediments. Remediation may be required by Regulations before the Development of Land Revitalization Projects. Developers who agree to voluntary Cleanup may be offered Incentives under State or municipal Programs like the Brownfield Cleanup Program in new York State. If Remediation is done by Removal the Waste Materials are simply transported off-site for Disposal in another Location. The Waste Material can also be contained by physical Barriers such as Slurry Walls. The Use of Slurry Walls in the Construction Industry is well established. In Field Tests the Application of Pressure grouting used to mitigate Soil Liquefaction Risks in san Francisco and other Earthquake Zones has achieved mixed Results to create Barriers and site-specific Results depend upon many variable Conditions that can greatly impact."
