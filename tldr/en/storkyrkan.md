description: "Storkyrkan, also called Stockholms Domkyrka and Sankt Nikolai Kyrka, is the oldest Church in Stockholm. Storkyrkan is located in the Centre of Stockholm in Gamlastan between stockholm Palace and stortorget the old main Square of Stockholm. It was consecrated in 1306 to st Nicholas but Construction of the Church probably started in the 13th Century. Inside storkyrkan Preserves much of its late Medieval Appearance in the Form of a Church with a vaulted Ceiling supported by Brick Pillars. The Exterior of the Church is however uniformly Baroque in Appearance, the Result of extensive Changes made in the 18th Century. The Church played an important Role during the Reformation in Sweden as the Place where Mass was celebrated in Swedish for the first Time. It currently serves as the seat of the Bishop of Stockholm within the Church of Sweden since the creation of the Diocese of Stockholm in 1942."
