title: "Ovulatory shift hypothesis"
short_summary: "Hypothesis that female mating behavior changes throughout the menstrual cycle"
description: "The Hypothesis of the ovulatory Shift holds that Women experience evolutionarily adaptive Changes in their subconscious Thoughts and Behaviors associated with mating during different Parts of the O. It suggests that what Women want in Terms of Men change throughout the menstrual Cycle. Two Meta-Analyses published in 2014 reached opposing Conclusions about whether the existing Evidence was robust enough to support the Prediction that Women's Mate Preferences change over the Cycle. A recent 2018 Review does not show that Women change the Type of Men they desire at different Times in their Fertility Cycle."
