Methamphetamine was discovered in 1893 and exists as two Enantiomers levo-methamphetamine and dextro-methamphetamine. Methamphetamine properly Refers to a specific Chemical Substance, the racemic free Base, which is an equal Mixture of Levomethamphetamine and Dextromethamphetamine in their Pure Amine Forms, but the Hydrochloride Salt, commonly called crystal Meth, is widely used. Methamphetamine is seldom prescribed over Concerns involving human Neurotoxicity and Potential for recreational Use as an Aphrodisiac and Euphoriant among other Concerns as well as the Availability of safer Substitute Drugs such as Adderall and Vyvanse. Dextromethamphetamine is a stronger Cns Stimulant than Levomethamphetamine."
