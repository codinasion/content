short_summary: "1932 German Christian hymn"
description: "Sonne Der Gerechtigkeit is a german christian Hymn with a complicated History. The Image of the Sun of Justice or Righteousness was created by Prophet Malachi. The Text was compiled by otto Riethmller around 1930 from older Stanzas by different Hymnwriters intended as a wake-up Call to the Church in a Germany facing the Rise of the Nazi. Four of its originally seven Stanzas were written in the 18th Century, two by Johann Christian Nehring, and two by christian David. The remaining Stanzas were taken from christian Gottlob Barth written in the 19th Century. A seventh Stanza Alternative was suggested in 1970 with a strong ecumenical Focus. The Hymn expresses a Call for Justice Renewal and Unity within the Congregation and Church and among the Peoples."
