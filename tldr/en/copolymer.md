short_summary: "Polymer derived from more than one species of monomer"
description: "In polymer Chemistry a Copolymer is a Polymer derived from more than one Species of Monomer. The Polymerization of Monomers into Copolymers is called Copolymerization. Copolymers obtained by Copolymerization of two Monomer Species are sometimes called Bipolymers. Those from three and four Monomers are called Terpolymers and Quaterpolymers respectively. Copolymers can be characterized by a Variety of Techniques such as nmr Spectroscopy and Size Exclusion Chromatography to determine the molecular Size Weight Properties and Composition of the."
