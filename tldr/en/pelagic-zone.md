title: "Pelagic zone"
short_summary: "Unobstructed water in the body of the sea that is neither close to the surface nor to the sea floor"
description: "The Pelagic Zone consists of the Water Column of the open Ocean and can further be divided by Depth into Regions. The Word Pelagic comes from ancient greek'open Sea'. The pelagic Zone can be thought of as an imaginary Cylinder or Water Column between the Surface and Bottom of the Sea. Conditions in the Water Column Change with Depth: Pressure increases ; Temperature and light Decrease ; Salinity, Oxygen, Micronutrients all Change. Somewhat analogous to Stratification in the Earth's Atmosphere, but depending on how deep the Water is, the Water Column can be divided vertically into up to five different Layers."
