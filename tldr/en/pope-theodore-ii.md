His main Act as Pope was to annul the recent Cadaver Synod thus reinstating the Acts and Ordinations of Pope Formosus which had themselves been annulled by Pope Stephen Vi. He also collected Formosus' Body from the Tiber River and had it reburied with Honour. He died in Office in late December 897."
