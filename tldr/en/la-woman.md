short_summary: "1971 studio album by the Doors"
description: "L. A. Woman is the sixth Studio Album by the American Rock band the Doors, released on April 19, 1971 by Elektra Records. It is the last to feature lead Singer Jim Morrison during his Lifetime, due to his Death exactly two Months and two Weeks following the Album's Release, though he would posthumously appear on the 1978 Album an american Prayer. Even more so than its Predecessors, the Album is heavily influenced by Blues. It was recorded without Producer Paul A. Rothchild after he quit the Band over the perceived Lack of Quality in their Studio Performances. The Band produced the Album after that with longtime Sound Engineer Bruce Botnick."
