title: "Cell wall"
short_summary: "Outermost layer of some cells"
description: "A Cell Wall is a structural Layer that surrounds some Cell Types that are located immediately outside the Cell Membrane. It can be tough, flexible, and sometimes rigid. Primarily, it provides the Cell with structural Support, Shape, Protection, and Functions as a selective Barrier. Another vital Role of the Cell Wall is to help the Cell withstand osmotic Pressure and mechanical Stress. While Absent in many Eukaryotes, including Animals, Cell Walls are prevalent in other Organisms such as Fungi, Algae and Plants, and are commonly found in most Prokaryotes, with the Exception of Mollicute Bacteria."
