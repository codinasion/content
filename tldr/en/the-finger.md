short_summary: "Obscene hand gesture"
description: "The Finger or middle Finger in western Culture is an obscene Hand Gesture. The Gesture communicates moderate to extreme Contempt, and is roughly equivalent in meaning to 'fuck you', 'fuck me', 'shove it up your Ass/Arse', 'up Yours', or 'go fuck yourself'. It is performed by showing the Back of a Hand with only the middle Finger extended Upwards though in some Areas the Thumb is extended. Extending the Finger is considered a Symbol of Contempt in several Cultures especially in the western World. Many Cultures use similar Gestures to display their disrespect though Others use it to express pointing without intentional Disrespect. The Gesture is usually used to express Contempt but can also be humorous or jovial."
