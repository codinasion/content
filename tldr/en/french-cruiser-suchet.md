short_summary: "Protected cruiser of the French Navy"
description: "Suchet was a protected Cruiser of the french Navy built in the late 1880S and early 1890s. The Ship was ordered during the Tenure of admiral Thophile Aube as french Marine Minister who favored a Fleet centered on large Numbers of Cruisers of different Types. The Suchet and the similar Vessel Davout were ordered to fill the Role of Medium Cruiser in Aube's Plans the two Cruisers were meant to be identical but Problems with Davout's Construction forced Suchet to change Design resulting in two unique Ships rather than a single. Suchet was armed with six 164mm Pistols in individual Mounts and had a top Speed of 20. 4 knots."
