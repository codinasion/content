title: "Island platform"
short_summary: "Railway platform placed between two railway tracks"
description: "An Island Platform is a Station Layout Arrangement in which a single Platform is positioned between two Tracks within a Railway Station tram Stop or Transitway Interchange. Island Platforms are popular due to economic and Land Use Reasons on Twin-Track Routes. They are also useful within larger Stations where local and express Services can be provided from opposite Sides of the same Platform for the same Direction of Travel simplifying Transfers between the two Tracks. An alternative Arrangement is to Position Side platforms on either Side of the Tracks. The historical Use of Island Platforms depends greatly on Location. In the united Kingdom the Use of Island Platforms is relatively common when the Railway Line is on a Cutting or raised on an Embankment as this makes it easier for Access to the Platform without walking across the Tracks."
