Some of the Elements of the modern Ceremonies Date back to the ancient Games from which the modern Olympics derive their Origins. One Example of this is the Prominence of Greece in both the Opening and Closing Ceremonies. During the 2004 Games, the Medal Winners received a Crown of olive Branches, which was a direct Reference to the Ancient Games, in which the Victor's Prize was an olive Wreath. The various Elements of the Ceremonies are mandated by the Olympic Charter and ca n't be changed by the Host Nation.
