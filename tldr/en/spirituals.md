title: "Spirituals"
short_summary: "Music genre created by generations of Black Americans"
description: "Spirituals is a Genre of christian Music that is associated with african Americans which merged sub-saharan african cultural Heritage with the Experiences of being held in Slavery first during the transatlantic Slave Trade and then for Centuries Afterwards through the domestic Slave Trade. Spirituals encompass the 'sing Songs', Work Songs, and Plantation Songs that evolved into the Blues and gospel Songs in Church. In the nineteenth Century the Word Spirituals referred to all these Subcategories of Folk Songs. While they were often rooted in biblical Stories, they also described the extreme Hardships endured by african Americans who were enslaved from the 17th Century until the 1860S, the Emancipation altering mainly the Nature of Slavery for many. Many new derivative Music Genres such as the Blues emerged from the Spirituals Songcraft."
