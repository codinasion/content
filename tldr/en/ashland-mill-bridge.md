short_summary: "United States historic place"
description: "The Ashland Mill Bridge was a lenticular Pony Truss Bridge over the Pachaug River in griswold Connecticut built in 1886 by the Berlin Iron Bridge Company. It was built after the Ashland Dam broke in february 1886 which washed away the previous Bridges. The Bridge served the Millyard of the Ashland Cotton Company in the Jewett City Section of Griswold. The Bridge was 65 Feet long and crossed a Millrace at a Skew Angle. The Ashland Mill was damaged by Arson in March 1995 and subsequently torn down but the Bridge itself remained intact. By 1999 the Town deemed the Bridge unsafe and closed it and the Bridge was moved to a vacant Parking Lot and replaced by a new Bridge in february 1999. The Bridge was added to the historic Register of the State of Connecticut and later added to the national Register of historic Places in April 1999. In february 2016 it was removed from the national Register."
