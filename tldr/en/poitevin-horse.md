It was formed in the 17th Century when Horses of flemish or dutch Origin brought into the Area by Engineers working to drain the Marais Poitevin interbred with local Horses. Although it has the Size and Conformation of a Draft Horse, the Poitevin has never been bred for Draft Abilities, and has been little used for Draft Work. Its principal traditional Use was the Production of Mules. Poitevin Mares were placed to the Jacks of the large Baudet Du poitou Breed of Donkeys and the resulting poitevin Mules were in Demand in many Parts of the World including Russia and the united States. In the early twentieth Century there were 50000 Brood Mares producing between 18000 and 20000 Mules per Year."
