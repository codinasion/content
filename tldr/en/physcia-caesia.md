short_summary: "Blue-gray foliose lichen found throughout much of the world"
description: "Physcia Caesia, known colloquially as blue-gray Rosette Lichen and Powder-Back Lichen, is a Species of foliose lichenized Fungus. It was described first in 1784 by Georg Franz Hoffmann and is prevalent across much of europe North America and new Zealand and more patchily distributed in south america Asia Australia and Antarctica. There are 2 Subspecies: P. C. Caesia and P. C. Ventosa, as well as a Number of distinct Forms and Varieties. Molecular Studies suggest that the Species as currently defined may be polyphyletic. It is typically light Grey shading to darker Gray in the Center and Grows in a small Rosette usually around 23cm Across at Maturity. It only rarely has apothecia, instead reproducing most often vegetatively via Soredia, which are piled in Round blue-gray Mounds across the Thallus's upper Surface. It grows most often on rock—principally calcareous, but also basaltic and Siliceous—And also occurs on Bone, Bark and Soil. It is nitrophilic and is particularly common on a Substrate on which Birds Rest."
