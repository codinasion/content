In the last Decade of the eleventh Century Ingimundr was tasked by Magns to take Control of the Kingdom of the Isles. The Realm had descended into utter Chaos after the Death of Gurr Crovan King of the Isles in 1095 which was followed by kin-strife Amongst Gurr's Descendants and the Encroachment. Ingimundr and his Followers were murdered by the leading Islesmen in Lewis while he was securing the Kingship.
