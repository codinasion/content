title: "Nitrogen narcosis"
short_summary: "Reversible narcotic effects of respiratory nitrogen at elevated partial pressures"
description: "Narcosis while diving is a reversible Alteration in Consciousness that occurs while diving at Depth. It is caused by the anesthetic effect of certain gases at high pressure. The greek Word Νάρκωσις, 'the Act of making numb', is derived from Νάρκη, 'Numbness, Torpor', a Term used by Homer and Hippocrates. Narcosis produces a State similar to drunkenness or nitrous oxide Inhalation. It can occur during shallow Dives but is usually not noticeable at Depths less than 30 Meters."
