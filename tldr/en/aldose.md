short_summary: "Class of monosaccharides"
description: "An Aldose is a Monosaccharide with a Carbon Backbone Chain with a Carbonyl Group on the Endmost Carbon Atom, making it an Aldehyde, and Hydroxyl Groups connected to all the other Carbon Atoms. Aldoses can be distinguished from Ketoses which have the Carbonyl Group away from the End of the Molecule and are therefore Ketones."
