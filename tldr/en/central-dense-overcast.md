title: "Central dense overcast"
short_summary: "Large central area of thunderstorms surrounding its circulation center"
description: "The central Dense Overcast or Cdo of a tropical Cyclone or strong subtropical Cyclone is the central Area of Thunderstorms around its Circulation Center caused by the Formation of its Eyewall. It can be round, angular, oval, or Irregular in Shape. This Feature shows up in tropical Cyclones of hurricane-force Hurricane Strength. How far the Center is embedded within the Cdo, and the Temperature Difference between the Cloud Tops within the Cdo and the Cyclone's Eye, can help determine a tropical Cyclone's Intensity with the Dvorak Technique. Finding the Center of the Cdo can be a Problem with strong tropical Storms and minimal Hurricanes as its Location can be obscured by the Cdo's high Cloud Canopy. This center location problem can be resolved through the use of microwave satellite imagery."
