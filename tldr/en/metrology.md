short_summary: "Science of measurement and its application"
description: "Metrology is the scientific Study of Measurement. It establishes a common Understanding of Units critical in linking human Activities. Modern Metrology has its Roots in the political Motivation to standardise Units in France during the french Revolution when a Length Standard was proposed from a natural Source. This led to the Creation of the decimal-based metric System in 1795 which established a Set of Standards for other Types of Measurements. Several other Countries adopted the metric System between 1795 and 1875 to ensure Consistency between the Countries the Bureau international Des Poids et Mesures was established by the Metre Convention. This has evolved to the international System of Units in 1960 as a Result of a Resolution at the 11th general Conference on Weights and Measures."
