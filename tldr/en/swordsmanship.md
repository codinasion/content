The Term is modern and as such was primarily used to refer to smallsword fencing but by Extension can also be applied to any martial Art involving the Use of a Sword. The Formation of the English Word 'Swordsman' is parallel to the Latin Word Gladiator, a Term for the professional Fighters who fought against each other and a Variety of other Foes for the Entertainment of Spectators in the Roman Empire.
