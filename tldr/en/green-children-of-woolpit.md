description: "The Legend of the green Children of Woolpit Concerns two Children of unusual skin Colour who were reported to have appeared sometime in the 12th Century in Woolpit in Suffolk England perhaps during the Reign of king Stephen. The Children, found to be brother and sister, were of generally normal Appearance except for the green Colour of their Skin. They spoke a Language that was unknown and would only eat raw broad Beans. Eventually, they learned to eat other Food and lost their green Colour, but the Boy was sickly and died soon after his Sister was baptized. The Girl adjusted to her new Life, but she was considered to be 'very wanton and impudent'. The Girl explained that she and her Brother had come from a Land where the Sun never Shone and where the Light was like Twilight. According to one Version of the Story, she said that Everything there was green ; according to another, she said it was called Saint Martin's Land."
