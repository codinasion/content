title: "1858 Atlantic hurricane season"
short_summary: "Hurricane season in the Atlantic Ocean"
description: "The 1858 Atlantic hurricane season was one of only three Atlantic hurricane seasons on record in which every tropical cyclone intensified into a hurricane. The first Hurricane was first observed on June 12th over the northwestern Caribbean Sea. The sixth and final Storm was last observed on october 26th. These Dates fall within the Period with the most tropical Cyclone Activity in the atlantic Ocean. Three tropical Cyclones were simultaneously present during the same Season. Two of the Cyclones have only a single known Point of tracking due to a sparse Amount of Data. Operationally, another tropical Cyclone was believed to have existed over the eastern Atlantic between September 17 and September 18, but Hurdat – the official Atlantic Hurricane Database – excludes this System. However, in the Absence of modern Satellite and other remote-sensing Technologies, only cyclones that affected populated Land Areas or encountered Ships at Sea are currently known, so the actual Total could be higher. Between 1886 and 1910 the Undercount Bias of Zero to four tropical Cyclones per Year was estimated. Five of six atlantic Cyclones known in 1858 were first documented in 1995 by jose Fernandez-Partagas and Henry Diaz."
