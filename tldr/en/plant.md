short_summary: "Kingdom of photosynthetic eukaryotes"
description: "Plants are the Eukaryotes that form the Plant Kingdom but are mostly photosynthetic. This means they get their Energy from sunlight using Chloroplasts from Endosymbiosis with Cyanobacteria to produce Sugars from Carbon Dioxide and Water using the green Pigment Chlorophyll. Exceptions are parasitic Plants that have lost the Genes for Chlorophyll and Photosynthesis and obtain their Energy from other Plants or Fungi."
