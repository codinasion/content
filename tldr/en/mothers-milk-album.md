description: "Mother's Milk is the fourth studio album by American rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers, released on August 16, 1989 by EMI Records. Following the Death of Founder Guitarist Hillel Slovak and the subsequent Departure of drummer Jack Irons vocalist anthony Kiedis and Bassist Flea regrouped with the Addition of Guitarist John Frusciante and Drummer Chad smith. Frusciante's Influence altered the Band's Sound by placing more Emphasis on Melody than on Rhythm which had dominated the previous Material of the Band. Returning Producer michael Beinhorn favored heavy Metal Guitar Riffs as well as overdubbing. Frusciante perceived Beinhorn's Taste as excessive and as a Result the two struggled over the Album's Guitar Sound frequently."
