The Highway connects port Colborne near lake Erie with Highway406 in Welland via main Street Tunnel. It was built as Part of the Welland Bypass Project of the Welland Canal in the early 1970s which resulted in the Severance of several Highways and Rail Lines. Opened to Traffic in late 1972, several Months following the Tunnel, Highway 140 has remained unchanged since, despite growing Calls to resign it as an Extension of Highway 406."
