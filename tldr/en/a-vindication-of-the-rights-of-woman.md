description: "A Vindication of the Rights of Women with Restrictions on political and moral Subjects written by british Philosopher and Women's Rights advocate mary Wollstonecraft is one of the early Works of feminist Philosophy. Wollstonecraft Responds to those educational and political Theorists of the 18th Century who did not believe in a rational Education for Women. She argues that Women ought to have an Education Commensurate with their Position in Society, claiming that Women are essential to the Nation because they educate its Children and because they could be 'Companions' to their Husbands, rather than mere Wives. Wollstonecraft instead of viewing Women as Ornaments to society or Property to be traded in Marriage Asserts that they are human Beings deserving of the same fundamental Rights as Men."
