The next Year his Father Agrippina married the fourth and final Marriage of the younger Claudius. Their Marriage was followed by the Adoption of Agrippina's Son Lucius Domitius whose Name as a Result became nero. His Stepbrother would later be married to Britannicus' Sister Octavia and soon eclipsed him as Claudius' Heir. After his Father's Death in october 1954 Nero became Emperor. The sudden Death of Britannicus shortly before his fourteenth Birthday is reported by all extant Sources as being the Result of poisoning on Nero's Orders ; as Claudius' biological Son, he represented a Threat to Nero's Claim to the Throne."
