title: "MÃ¼llerian mimicry"
short_summary: "Mutually beneficial mimicry of strongly defended species"
description: "Mllerian Mimicry is a natural Phenomenon in which two or more well-defended Species often foul-tasting and sharing common Predators have come to mimic each other's honest Warning Signals to their mutual Benefit. The Benefit to mllerian Mimics is that Predators only need one unpleasant Encounter with a Member of a Set of mllerian Mimics and thereafter avoid all similar Coloration whether or not it belongs to the same Species as the initial Encounter. It is named after the german Naturalist Fritz Mller who first proposed the Concept in 1878 supporting his Theory with the first mathematical Model of frequency-dependent Selection one of the first such Models in Biology."
