short_summary: "2002 video game"
description: "Ethnic Cleansing is a 2002 first-person Shooter produced by the National Alliance, an american white Supremacy and neo-nazi Organization. The Player controls one of three selectable Characters, including a Ku Klux Klan Member and a neo-nazi Skinhead, and traverses two Levels to kill stereotypically depicted african Americans, Latinos, and Jews, culminating in a Fight against Ariel Sharon, the prime Minister of Israel. Designed to be politically incorrect and spread a white supremacy message, the game was released through the National Alliance's record label, Resistance Records, on Martin Luther King Jr. Day 2002. It was negatively received by anti-hate Organizations like the anti-defamation League of B'Nai B'Rith and was considered one of the most controversial and most racist Games in the Game. Resistance Records sought to release a Series of Games based on the Turner Diaries and published white Law in 2003."
