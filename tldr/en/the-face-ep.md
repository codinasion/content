short_summary: "2012 EP by Disclosure"
description: "The Face is the second extended Play of british electronic Music Duo Disclosure, consisting of Guy and Howard Lawrence. It was released on 4 June 2012, by the Greco-Roman Label, its Remix Ep, which features a Re-Cut of 'Control' by Hot Chip's Joe Goddard, distributed in September 2012. The Four-Track Record, which contains musical Styles of balearic Beat, Uk Garage, Dubstep and Techno, features vocal Contributions from Sin√©ad Harnett and Ria Ritchie. It was described by one reviewer as more a 'youthful' Release of a Dubstep and techno Scene consisting of Artists like James Blake and Little Dragon. The Ep is a big Departure from their previous Works in Terms of musical Style, its few post-dubstep Elements to be the only Ones that were also present on their past Releases. Promoted one single, 'Boiling', and one Music Video for 'Control', the Face garnered critical Acclaim, major Praises being towards the Quality of the Ep's musical Style and Song Structures."
