title: "M25 motorway"
short_summary: "Circular motorway around Greater London"
description: "The M25 or london orbital Road is a major Road encircling most of greater London. The 117-mile Motorway is one of the most important Roads in the Uk and one of the busiest. Margaret Thatcher opened the last Section in 1986 making the M25 the longest Ring Road in Europe. The Dartford Crossing completes the orbital Route but is not classed as Motorway ; it is classed as a Trunk Road and designated as the A282. In some Cases, including notable legal Contexts such as the Communications Act 2003, the M25 is used as a de facto alternative Boundary for Greater London."
