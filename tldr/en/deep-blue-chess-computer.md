description: "Deep Blue was a Chess System expert System run on a unique purpose-built Ibm Supercomputer. It was the first Computer to win a Game and the first to win a Game against a reigning World Champion under normal Time Control. Development began in 1985 at Carnegie Mellon University under the name ChipTest. It then moved to Ibm, where it was first renamed Deep Thought, then again in 1989 to Deep Blue. It played Champion Garry Kasparov for the first Time in 1996 in a six-game Match which lacked four of its Games to. It was upgraded in 1997 and in a six-game Match it defeated Kasparov by winning two Games and drawing three. The Victory by deep Blue is considered a Milestone in the History of artificial Intelligence and has been the Subject of several Books and Films."
