description: "Dota 2 is a Multiplayer online Battle arena Game from Valve in 2013. The Game is a Sequel to Defense of the Ancients, a community-created Mod for Blizzard Entertainment's Warcraft Iii: Reign of Chaos. Dota 2 is played in Matches between two Teams of five Players, with each Team occupying and defending their own separate Base on the Map. Each of the Ten Players independently controls a powerful Character known as a 'Hero' that all have unique Abilities and differing Styles of Play. During a Match Players collect Experience Points and Items for their Heroes to defeat the opposing Team's Heroes in Player Versus Player Combat. A Team wins by being the first to destroy the other Team's 'Ancient', a large Structure located within their Base."
