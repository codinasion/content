title: "Japanese aircraft carrier Shinano"
short_summary: "Aircraft carrier of the Imperial Japanese Navy"
description: "Shinano was an Aircraft Carrier built by the Imperial Japanese Navy during World War Ii, the largest such built up to that Time. Laid down in May 1940 as the third of the Yamato-class battleships, Shinano's partially complete hull was ordered to be converted to an aircraft carrier following Japan's disastrous loss of four of its original six fleet carriers at the Battle of Midway in mid-1942. The advanced State of her Construction prevented her Conversion to a Fleet Carrier so that the Ijn decided to convert her into a Carrier that supported other Carriers."
