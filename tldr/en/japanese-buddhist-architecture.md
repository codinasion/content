short_summary: "Architecture of Buddhist temples in Japan"
description: "Japanese Buddhist architecture is the architecture of Buddhist temples in Japan, consisting of locally developed variants of architectural styles born in China. After Buddhism arrived via the three Kingdoms of Korea from the Continent in the 6th Century an Effort was initially made to reproduce the original Buildings as faithfully as possible but gradually local Versions of continental Styles were developed both to meet japanese Tastes and to solve Problems posed by local Weather which is more rainy and humid. The first Buddhist Sects were the six nanto Rokush of Nara followed by the Shingon and Tendai of Kyoto during the heian Period. Later, during the Kamakura Period, in Kamakura were born the Jōdo and the native japanese sect Nichiren-Shū. At roughly the same Time, Zen Buddhism arrived from China, strongly influencing all other Sects in many Ways, including in Architecture. The social Composition of the Buddhist Followers also changed radically with Time. Beginning as an elite Religion, it slowly spread from the Nobility to Warriors and Merchants, and finally to the Population at large. On the technical Side, new Woodworking Tools like the framed Pit Saw and the Plane allowed new architectural Solutions."
