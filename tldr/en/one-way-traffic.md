title: "One-way traffic"
short_summary: "Traffic that moves in a single direction"
description: "One Way Traffic is Traffic that moves in a single Direction. A one Way Street is a Street facilitating either one Way Traffic or designed to direct Vehicles in one Direction. One-way Streets usually result in higher Traffic Flow as Drivers may avoid encountering oncoming Traffic or turning through oncoming Traffic. Residents may dislike one-way Streets because of the circuitous Route required to get to a specific Destination and the Potential for higher Speeds negatively affecting pedestrian Safety. Some Studies challenge the original Motivation for one-way Streets in that the circuitous Routes negate the Claimed higher Speeds."
