short_summary: "High end hifi cassette deck"
description: "The nakamichi Dragon is an audio Cassette Deck introduced by Nakamichi in 1982 and marketed until 1994. The Dragon was the first Nakamichi Model with bidirectional Replay Capability and the World's first Production Tape Recorder with an automatic Azimuth Correction System ; this Feature, which was invented by Philips Engineers and improved by Niro Nakamichi, continuously adjusts the Azimuth of the Replay Head to minimize apparent Head Skew and correctly reproduce the treble signal Present on the Tape. The System allows the correct Reproduction of mechanically skewed Cassettes and Recordings made on misaligned Decks. Similar Systems have been used in the nakamichi td-1200 Car Cassette Player and in the marantz sd-930 Cassette Deck except for the Dragon."
