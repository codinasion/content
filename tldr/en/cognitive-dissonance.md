title: "Cognitive dissonance"
short_summary: "Stress from contradictory beliefs"
description: "In the Field of Psychology cognitive Dissonance is the Perception of contradictory Information and the mental Toll of it. Relevant Items of Information include a Person's Actions, Feelings, Ideas, Beliefs, Values, and Things in the Environment. Cognitive Dissonance is generally experienced as psychological Stress when People participate in an Action that goes against one or more of these Things. According to this Theory, when an Action or Idea is psychologically inconsistent with the other, People do all in their Power to change either so that they become consistent. The Discomfort is triggered by the Person's Belief clashing with new Information perceived, wherein the individual Tries to find a Way to resolve the Contradiction to reduce their Discomfort."
