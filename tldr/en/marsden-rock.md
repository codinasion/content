short_summary: "Rock formation in Tyne and Wear, United Kingdom"
description: "Marsden Rock is a Rock in Tyne and Wear, North East England, situated in Marsden, South Shields. It is overlooked by the Marsden Grotto. The Rock is a 90 Foot Sea Stack of magnesian Limestone approximately 300 Feet above the main Cliff Face. It was previously known for its naturally-formed Arch. The Arch collapsed in 1996 following a Winter of Storms creating two separate Stacks. The smaller of the two was demolished in 1997 due to Safety Concerns. The remaining Stack is reachable on Foot at low Tide but is fully surrounded by Water at high Tide. The Cliffs around marsden Rock are an important Breeding Ground for Seabirds and Colonies can often be seen on the Rocks itself including Kittiwakes herring Gulls and Razorbills."
