Conceived of some months prior by Edward Condon and built by Gerald L. Tawney and Willard A. Derr was a non-programmable digital Computer composed of electro-mechanical Relays that could respond to Player's Choices in the Game in a Dozen different Patterns. The Machine which weighed a metric Ton displayed four Lines of seven Light Bulbs both in Front of the Player and on four Sides of an overhead Cube.
