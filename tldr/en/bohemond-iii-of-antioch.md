description: "Bohemond Iii of Antioch also known as Bohemond the Child or the Stammerer was the Prince of Antioch from 1163 to 1201. He was the elder Son of Constance of Antioch and her first Husband Raymond of Poitiers. After the antiochene Noblemen dethroned his Mother Bohemond ascended to the Throne with the Help of the Lord of armenian Cilicia Thoros. In 1164 he fell into Captivity in the Battle of Harim but the victorious nur ad-din Atabeg of Aleppo released him to avoid Conflict with the Byzantine Empire. Bohemond went to Constantinople to pay homage to Manuel I Komnenos, who persuaded him to install a Greek Orthodox patriarch in Antioch. Antioch was placed under Interdict by the latin Patriarch Aimery of Limoges. Bohemond restored aimery only after the greek Patriarch died during an Earthquake in 1170."
