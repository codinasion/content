title: "Impact event"
short_summary: "Collision of two astronomical objects"
description: "An impact Event is a Collision between astronomical Objects that causes measurable Effects. Impact Events have physical Consequences and have been found to regularly Occur in planetary Systems though the most frequent Involve Asteroids Comets or Meteoroids and have little Effect. When large Objects impact terrestrial Planets such as the Earth there can be significant physical and biospheric Consequences as the impacting Body Travels at a Rate of several Kilometers a second though Atmospheres mitigate many Surface Impacts through atmospheric Intrusion. Impact Craters and Structures are dominant Landforms on many of the solid Objects of the solar System and present the strongest empirical Evidence for their Frequency and Scale."
