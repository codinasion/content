He is often confused with another Alan de neville who was in the same Activity around the same Time but who was a royal Forester. It is possible that the Landholder was the Son of a Forester but this is not certain. The Uncertainty continues as to his Children, with some Sources saying he had four Sons while Others say he had no Children. It is known that neville co-founded the Tupholme Abbey in Lincolnshire."
