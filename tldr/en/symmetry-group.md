title: "Symmetry group"
short_summary: "Group of transformations under which the object is invariant"
description: "In Group Theory the Symmetry Group of a geometric Object is the Group of all Transformations under which the Object is invariant and endowed with the Group Operation of Composition. Such a Transformation is an invertible Mapping of the ambient Space that brings the Object back to itself and preserves all relevant structural Details of the Object. A frequent Notation for the Symmetry Group of an object X is g Sym."
