description: "The Piast Dynasty's Rule between the 10th and 14th Century represents the first major Stage in the History of the polish State. The Dynasty was founded by a Series of Dukes listed by the Chronicler Gall Anonymous in the early 12th Century: Siemowit, Lestek and Siemomysł. It was Mieszko i, the Son of Siemomysł, who is now considered the proper Founder of the polish State at about 960 Ad. The Ruling House remained in Power in polish Lands until 1370. Mieszko converted to Christianity of the Western Latin Church in an event known as the Baptism of Poland in 966, which established a major cultural boundary in Europe based on religion. He also completed the Unification of the lechitic Tribal lands that was fundamental to the Existence of the new Poland."
