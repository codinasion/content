short_summary: "Ship class"
description: "The C and d Class was a Group of 14 Destroyers built for the Royal Navy in the early 1930s. It was originally intended to Order a complete Flotilla comprising eight Destroyers plus a flotilla Leader as the ninth Unit each Year. However, only four ships—plus a leader—were ordered under the 1929–1930 Programme as the C Class. The other four Ships planned for the c Class were never ordered by Ramsay Macdonald's labour Government as an economic Measure and Disarmament Gesture. A complete flotilla—the 'D' class—was ordered under the 1930–1931 Programme."
