short_summary: "Ironclad warship of the French Navy"
description: "Amiral Duperré was an ironclad Barbette Ship built for the french Navy in the 1870s and 1880s ; she was the first Vessel of that Type built by France. She carried her main Battery of four 34 Cm Guns individually in open Barbette Mountings which offered increased Fire Fields compared to earlier central Battery Ships though they were less well protected. Amiral Duperr was ordered as Part of a french naval Construction Program aimed at countering the Growth of the italian Fleet that had begun Work in early 1870s on the very large Ironclads of the Duilio. The italian Vessels, armed with 45 Cm Guns, prompted public Outcry in France that pressured the Navy to develop larger Guns for its own Ships. The Design by amiral Duperr served as the Basis for several follow-on Classes including the Classes Bayard and amiral Baudin."
