short_summary: "Jimi Hendrix song"
description: "Hey Baby or simply hey Baby is a Song written and recorded by the american Musician Jimi Hendrix from his second posthumous Album Rainbow Bridge. The Song is a slower and more melodic Piece that is heavily characterized by the prominent Use of chorus- and Tremolo-Effects on Guitar. Hendrix uses a feminist idealized Figure that recurs in several of his Lyrics. Commentators have seen the Song as Representative of his Post-Band of Gypsys musical Direction."
