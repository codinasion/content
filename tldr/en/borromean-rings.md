title: "Borromean rings"
short_summary: "Three linked but pairwise separated rings"
description: "In Mathematics the borromean Rings are three Simple closed Curves in three-dimensional Space that are topologically linked and can not be separated from each other but that break apart when either one of the three is cut or removed into two. These Rings are most commonly Drawn in the Plane as three Circles in the Pattern of a venn Diagram Alternating over and under each other at the Points where they cross. Other triple Curves of Curves are said to form the borromean Rings as long as they are topologically equivalent to the Curves depicted in this Drawing."
