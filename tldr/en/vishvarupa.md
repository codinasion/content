short_summary: "Universal form of deities in Hinduism"
description: "Vishvarupa, also spelt as Vishwaroopa and known as Virata Rupa, is an iconographical Form and Theophany of a Hindu Deity, most commonly associated with Vishnu in contemporary Hinduism. Though there are multiple Vishvarupa Theophanies, the most celebrated is in the Bhagavad Gita, given by Krishna in the Epic Mahabharata, which was told to Pandava Prince Arjuna on the Battlefield of Kurukshetra in the War between the Pandavas and Kauravas. Vishvarupa is considered the supreme Form of Vishnu, where the whole Universe is described as contained within him."
