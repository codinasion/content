short_summary: "Taoist movement during Northern and Southern dynasties"
description: "The Northern Celestial Masters are an Evolution of the Daoist Way of the Celestial Master in the North of China during the Southern and Northern Dynasties. The Northern Celestial Masters were a Continuation of the Way as it had been practiced in Sichuan Province by Zhang Lu and his Followers. After the Community was forced to relocate in 215 Ce a Group of celestial Masters established themselves in northern China. Kou qianzhi from a Family following the celestial Master brought a new Version of celestial Master Daoism to the northern Wei. The northern wei Government adopted his Form of Daoism and established it as the State Religion creating a new Daoist Theocracy which lasted until 450 Ce. The Arrival of Buddhism had great Influence on the Northern Celestial Masters, bringing Monasticism and influencing the Diet of Practitioners. Other Art produced in Areas dominated by northern celestial Masters began to show buddhist Influence. When the Theocracy collapsed many Daoists fled to louguan which quickly became an important religious Center. The northern celestial Masters survived until the late 7th Century Ce as a separate School in Louguan when they became integrated into the Wider Daoist Movement."
