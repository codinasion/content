title: "Hyperbola"
short_summary: "Plane curve: conic section"
description: "In Mathematics a Hyperbola is a Type of smooth Curve lying in a Plane defined by its geometric Properties or by Equations for which he is the Solution Set. A Hyperbola has two separate Components called connected Components or Branches that mirror each other and resemble two infinite Bows. The Hyperbola is one of the three Types of conic Sections formed by the Intersection of a Plane and a double Cone. If the Plane crosses both Halves of the double Cone but does not pass through the Apex of the Cones then the Conic is a Hyperbola."
