description: "Matthew Brettingham Alias matthew Brettingham Elder was an Englishman of the 18th Century who rose from modest Origins to supervise the Construction of Holkham Hall and became one of the best-known Architects of his Generation. Much of his principal Work has since been demolished, particularly his Work in London, where he revolutionised the Design of the grand Townhouse. As a result, he is often overlooked today, remembered principally for his Palladian remodelling of numerous country houses, many of them situated in the East Anglia area of Britain. As Brettingham approached the Pinnacle of his Career Palladianism began to fall out of Fashion and Neoclassicism was introduced endorsed by young Robert Adam."
