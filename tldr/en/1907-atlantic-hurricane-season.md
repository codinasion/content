short_summary: "Hurricane season in the Atlantic Ocean"
description: "The atlantic Hurricane Season 1907 was a very inactive Hurricane Season. Only five tropical Storms were formed and None reached Hurricane Strength. This Season is one of only two that has not produced Hurricanes. Three Storms made Landfall in the Season all on the Gulf Coast of the united States. The first Storm of the Season formed on June 24 while the final dissipated on November 12. No Deaths were reported from the Storms but the Damage was minimal. Due to the Lack of modern Technology, including satellite Imagery, Information is often sparse, and four additional Systems could have formed during the Season. A Documentation of four possible Storms during the Season exists although it has not been proved that these Systems were fully tropical."
