short_summary: "Five Capcom video games for GameCube"
description: "The Capcom five are five Video Games that were released by Capcom in late 2002 and were unveiled in March 2003. At a Time when Nintendo's Gamecube Console had failed to capture Market Share Capcom announced five new Gamecube Titles with the apparent Goal of boosting Hardware Sales and demonstrating third-party Developer Support. Capcom Usa followed up with Confirmation that they would be exclusive to the Gamecube. The five Games were P. N. 03, a futuristic third-person Shooter ; Viewtiful Joe, a side-scrolling Action-Platformer ; Dead Phoenix, a Shoot'em up ; Resident Evil 4, a survival Horror third-person Shooter ; and Killer7, an action-adventure Game with first-person Shooter Elements. Though not directly related to each other, they were all overseen by Resident Evil director Shinji Mikami and, except Killer7, developed by Capcom's Production Studio 4. Capcom Usa later clarified that only Resident Evil 4 was intended to be exclusive ; the initial Announcement was due to a Miscommunication with their Parent Company."
