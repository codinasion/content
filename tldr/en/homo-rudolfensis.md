short_summary: "Extinct hominin from the Early Pleistocene of East Africa"
description: "Homo Rudolfensis is an extinct Species of archaic Human from the early Pleistocene of east Africa about 2 million Years ago. Because H. Rudolfensis coexisted with several other Hominins, it is debated what specimens can be confidently assigned to this Species beyond the lectotype Skull Knm-Er 1470 and other partial Skull Aspects. No Bodily remains are definitively assigned to H. rudolfensis. Consequently, both its generic Classification and Validity are debated without any wide Consensus, with some recommending the Species to actually belong to the Genus Australopithecus as A. Rudolfensis or Kenyanthropus as K. Rudolfensis, or that it is synonymous with the contemporaneous and anatomically similar H. habilis."
