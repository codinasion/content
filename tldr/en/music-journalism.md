description: "Music Journalism is Media Criticism and reporting about Music Topics, including popular Music, classical Music, and traditional Music. Journalists began writing about Music in the 18th Century providing Commentary on what is now regarded as classical Music. In the 1960S, Music Journalism began more prominently covering popular Music like Rock and Pop after the Breakthrough of the Beatles. With the Rise of the Internet in the 2000s, Music Criticism developed an increasingly large online Presence with Music Bloggers, aspiring Music Critics, and established Critics supplementing Print Media Online. Music Journalism Today includes Reviews of Songs, Albums and live Concerts, Profiles of recording Artists, and Reporting of artist News and Music Events."
