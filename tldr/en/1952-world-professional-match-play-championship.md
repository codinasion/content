short_summary: "Snooker tournament"
description: "The 1952 World professional Match-Play Championship was a Snooker Tournament held from 12 november 1951 until 15 March 1952 with the final Event taking Place at Tower Circus in Blackpool England. The Event was created following a Dispute between the professional Billiard Players' Association and the Billiards Association and Control Council. The Bacc claimed that the Championship was primarily about Honour, and financial Consideration should come behind this, whilst the Pbpa Members felt that the Bacc was taking too large a Share of the Income from the Events and established an alternative'world Championship' called the World Professional Match-Play Championship, Editions of which are now recognised as World Championships."
