short_summary: "Nonstop flight made by the USAAF after WW2"
description: "The 1945 Japan–Washington Flight was a record-breaking Air Voyage made by three specially modified Boeing B-29 Superfortresses on September 18–19, 1945, from the northern japanese Island of Hokkaidō to Chicago in the Midwestern United States, continuing to Washington, D. C. The Flight was made by three Air Force Generals and other Airmen returning from their overseas Duty after World War Ii to the united States. At that Date, it involved the heaviest Load carried by an american Aircraft, the longest nonstop Flight made by the Usaaf, and the first nonstop Flight from Japan to the United States made with a complete Aircraft. However the Flight did not break the then World Distance Record established in 1938 by the Royal Air Force. It's worth noting that the Martin Pb2M was much earlier measured at 144000 Lb. Also, the Tests of the B-29 under the Leadership of E. H. Rowley in June, 1945 with Grand Slam Bombs may have been run at similar Loads."
