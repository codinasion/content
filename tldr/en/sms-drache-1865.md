short_summary: "Gunboat of the Prussian and German Imperial Navy"
description: "Sms Drache was a camleon-class Gunboat of the prussian Navy which was launched in 1860. Budgetary Problems delayed her Completion until 1869 and she entered Service for the first Time during the franco-prussian War in 1870 though she saw no significant Action against the french Navy. Drache spent most of her Career conducting Survey Work in the north Sea between 1872 and 1887 which later proved instrumental to the Operations of german u-boats and Minelayers during World War I. Drache was decommissioned in 1887 reduced to a Coal Hulk and then used in 1889 as a Target for the Torpedo Boat D5. Her Wreck was later raised and broken up."
