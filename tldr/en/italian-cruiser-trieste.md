title: "Italian cruiser Trieste"
short_summary: "Heavy cruiser of the Italian Royal Navy"
description: "Trieste was the second of two heavy Cruisers of the Trento Class built for the italian Regia Marina. The Ship was laid down in June 1925, was launched in October 1926, and was commissioned in December 1928. Trieste was very light armored with only a 70mm Thick armored Belt though she possessed a high Speed and heavy main Battery of eight 203mm Guns. Though nominally built under the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty, the two cruisers significantly exceeded the displacement limits imposed by the treaty. The Ship spent the 1930s conducting Training Cruises in the mediterranean Sea participating in naval Reviews held for foreign Dignitaries and serving as the Flagship of the Cruiser Division. She also helped transport italian Volunteer Troops sent to spain to fight in the spanish civil War who came back to italy in 1938."
