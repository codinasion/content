description: "Black Moshannon State Park is a 3,480-acre Pennsylvania State Park in Rush Township, Centre County, Pennsylvania, United States. It surrounds black Moshannon lake formed by a Dam on black Moshannon Creek which gave its Name to the Lake and Park. The Park is west of the Allegheny Front 9 Miles east of Philipsburg on Pennsylvania Route 504 and is largely surrounded by the Moshannon State Forest. A Bog in the Park provides a Habitat for diverse Wildlife not common in other Areas of the State, such as carnivorous Plants, Orchids, and Species normally found farther north. As the largest reconstructed Bog in Pennsylvania it was chosen for the 25 Must-See Pennsylvania State Parks List by the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and natural Resources."
