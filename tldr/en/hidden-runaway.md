description: "Hidden Runaway is a 2012 Hidden object Game developed by the spanish Company Pendulo Studios and published by Bulkypix. It follows Protagonists Brian Basco and Gina Timmins as they retell Events from Runaway: a Road Adventure to a Film Producer interested in their Life Story. Along the Way the Player plays Mini-Games and Searches for Objects hidden in the Game's Environments. Hidden Runaway marked a Departure for Pendulo as it was the first casual Game and the first Project outside the graphic Adventure Genre for the Company."
