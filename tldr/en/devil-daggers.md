description: "Devil Daggers is a first-person Shooter Video Game developed by the Indie Development Team Sorath. Players are tasked with surviving on an Arena shrouded in Darkness as long as possible. The Player Character can fire Daggers from their Fingers to eliminate Foes and move about to avoid Contact with them. The Player dies from touching an Enemy and more Threats appear as Time Passes. Survival Times are recorded on a global Leaderboard where Replays of Playthroughs can be accessed and viewed. The Deliberate Use of unfiltered Textures and Effects like Polygon Jitter and Texture warping make its visual Style Reminiscent of early 3d Games released in the 1990s."
