short_summary: "Sailing vessel"
description: "A Schooner is a Type of sailing Vessel defined by its Rig Fore and Aft rigged on two or more Masts and in the Case of a two masted schooner the Foremast is generally shorter. A common Variant, the Topsail Schooner also has a square Topsail on the Foremast, to which may be added a Topgallant. Differing Definitions leave uncertain whether the Addition of a Fore Course would make such a Vessel a Brigantine. Many Schooners are gaff rigged but other Examples include the Bermuda Rig and Staysail Schooner."
