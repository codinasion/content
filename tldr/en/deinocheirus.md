short_summary: "Genus of theropod dinosaurs"
description: "Deinocheirus is a Genus of large Ornithomimosaurs which lived circa 70 million Years ago during the late cretaceous. In 1965 a Pair of large Arms Shoulder Girdles and a few other Bones of a new Dinosaur were discovered in Mongolia in the nemegt Formation. In 1970 this Specimen became the Holotype of the only Species within the Genus Deinocheirus mirificus the Genus Name means horror Hand in Greek. For nearly 50 Years no more Remains were discovered and its Nature remained a Mystery. In 2014 two more complete Specimens were described which shed Light on many Aspects of the Animal. Some Parts of these new Specimens had been stolen from mongolia several Years before but were returned in 2014."
