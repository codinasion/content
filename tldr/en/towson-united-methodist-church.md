description: "Towson United Methodist Church is a large United Methodist Church in the historic Hampton Subdivision of Towson, a Suburb in Baltimore County, Maryland. Its Past, rooted in 19th-century America and subsequent Growth in the two Centuries since then, has closely paralleled the Nation's political and sociological Trends. It was a Congregation Split in 1861 on the Eve of the American Civil War in a Border State of divided Loyalties, which eventually reunited and built a Church in the Post–World War Ii Era of the 1950s, a Time of Reconciliation and rapid Growth by Mainline Protestant Denominations, especially in the more affluent Suburbs."
