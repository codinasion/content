title: "Multiple-vortex tornado"
short_summary: "Tornado comprising multiple vortices"
description: "A multiple-vortex Tornado is a Tornado that contains several Vortices revolving around the main Vortex. The only Times when multiple Vortices are visible are when the Tornado is first formed or when Condensation and Debris are balanced such that Subvortices are apparent without being obscured. They can add up to 100mph to the ground-relative Wind in a tornado Circulation and are responsible for most Cases where narrow Arcs of extreme Destruction Lie right next to weak Damage within tornado Paths."
