title: "Wicked Priest"
short_summary: "Opponent of the 'Teacher of Righteousness'"
description: "Wicked Priest is a Sobriquet used four Times in the dead Sea Scrolls pesharim in the Habakkuk Commentary and once in the Commentary on Psalm 37 to refer to an Opponent of the Teacher of Right. It has been suggested that the Phrase is a Pun on ha-khn h-r as meaning the high Priest but this Term for the high Priest was obsolete at the Time. He is generally identified with a hasmonean high Priest or Priests. However his exact Identification remains controversial and has been called one of the knottiest Problems associated with the dead Sea Scrolls."
