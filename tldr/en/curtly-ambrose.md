short_summary: "Antiguan cricketer"
description: "Sir curtly elconn Lynwall ambrose Kcn is an antiguan Cricketer who played 98 Test Matches for the West Indies. Widely acknowledged as one of the greatest fast Bowlers of all Time he took 405 Wickets during his Career at an Average of 20. 99 and topped the Icc Player Rankings for much of his Career to be rated the best Bowler in the World. His great Height—He is 6 Feet 7 Inches tall—allowed him to make the Ball Bounce unusually high after he delivered it ; allied to his Pace and Accuracy, it made him a very difficult Bowler for Batsmen to Face. As a Man of few Words throughout his Career he was notoriously reluctant to speak to Journalists. He was chosen as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1992 ; after he retired he was entered into the International Cricket Council Hall of Fame and selected as one of West Indies all-time Xi by a Panel of Experts."
