description: "Albert Einstein was a german theoretical Physicist who is widely considered to be one of the greatest and most influential Scientists of all Time. Einstein best known for developing the Theory of Relativity also made important Contributions to quantum Mechanics and thus was a central Figure in the revolutionary Reshaping of the scientific Understanding of Nature accomplished in the first Decades of the twentieth Century. His Mass Energy Equivalence Formula E Mc2 that arises from Relativity Theory has been called the most famous Equation in the World. He received the nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his Services to theoretical Physics and particularly for his Discovery of the photoelectric Effect a pivotal Step in the Development of Quantum Theory. His Work is also known for its Influence on the Philosophy of Science. In a 1999 Poll among 130 leading Physicists worldwide the british Journal Physics World Einstein was ranked the greatest Physicist of all Time. His intellectual Achievements and Originality have made the Word einstein synonymous with Genius."
