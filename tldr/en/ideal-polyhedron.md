title: "Ideal polyhedron"
short_summary: "Shape in hyperbolic geometry"
description: "In three-dimensional hyperbolic Geometry an Ideal Polyhedron is a convex Polyhedron whose Vertices are ideal Points in the Infinite rather than in the three-dimensional Hyperbol. It can be defined as the Convex Hull of a finite Set of ideal Points. An Ideal Polyhedron has ideal Polygons as its faces Meet along the Lines of hyperbolic Space."
