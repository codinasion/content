description: "William de Longchamp was a medieval Lord Chancellor, Chief Justiciar, and Bishop of Ely in England. Born into a humble Family in Normandy he owed his Advancement to royal Favor. Although contemporary Writers accused Longchamp's Father of being the Son of a Peasant he held the Land as a Knight. Longchamp first served Henry Ii's Illegitimate Son Geoffrey, but quickly transferred to the Service of Richard i, Henry's Heir. When Richard became king in 1189 Longchamp paid 3000 for the Office of Chancellor and was shortly elected to the See or Bishopric of ely and appointed Legate by the Pope."
