description: "Be our Guest is a Song written by lyricist Howard Ashman and Composer Alan menken for the Disney animated Film Beauty and the Beast. Recorded by american Actor Jerry Orbach and English Actress Angela Lansbury as Lumi√®re and Mrs. Potts, respectively, 'be our Guest' is a large-scale broadway-inspired musical Number that takes Place during the first Half of Beauty and the Beast, performed by the Castle's Staff of enchanted Objects in an elaborate Attempt to welcome Belle. Menken initially intended for the Melody of be our guest to be temporary but ultimately was unable to compose a Satisfying Melody with which to replace it. The Song originally was intended for Belle's Father Maurice. However, 'be our Guest' had to be entirely re-written as the Story evolved in Order to return its Focus to Belle."
