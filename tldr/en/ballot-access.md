title: "Ballot access"
short_summary: "Aspect of United States election law"
description: "Elections in the united States have Rules and Procedures governing the Conditions under which a Candidate political Party or Ballot Measure is entitled to appear on Voters' Ballots. As Elections are decentralized by Article I Section 4 of the Constitution Ballot Access Laws are established and enforced by States. The Result is that the Process of Ballot Access may vary from State to State. State Access Requirements for Candidates generally pertain to personal Qualities of a Candidate, such as: minimum Age, Residency, and Citizenship. In Addition many States require prospective Candidates to collect a certain Number of qualified Voters' Signatures on Petitions of Support and mandate the Payment of filing Fees before granting Access to ballot Measures. In Addition each State regulates how political Parties qualify for automatic Ballot Access and how those minor Parties can. Fundamental Issues in the World of Democracy related to ballot Access are the Subject of considerable Debate in the united States."
