description: "11b-x-1371 is a 2015 viral Video sent to Gadgetzz. Com, the swedish Tech Blog that publicized it. The black-and-white Segment is two Minutes in Length and its Title came from the Plaintext of a Base64 String on the Dvd. It depicts a Person wearing what appears to be a plague Doctor Costume Walking and standing around in a dilapidated abandoned Building with a Forest Visible through former Window Openings in the Wall behind it. Accompanied by a Soundtrack of Loud, discordant Buzzing Noise, the masked Figure holds up a Hand with an irregularly Blinking Light. The Film did not have any Credits or Claims to authorship."
