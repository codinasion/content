short_summary: "729 battle of the Muslim conquest of Transoxiana"
description: "The Battle of Baykand was fought in 729 between Turkic trgesh Khaganate and its soghdian Allies and Arabs of the umayyad Caliphate at Baykand a Town near Bukhara in transoxian. The arab Army under the Governor of khurasan Ashras ibn abdallah Al-Sulami campaigned across the Oxus River to suppress a large scale Rebellion of the Subject soghdian Princes which had broken out the previous Year and received Trgesh. As the arab Army advanced on Bukhara, it was encircled by the Türgesh and cut off from Water. A Series of Engagements followed that almost ended in a Disaster for the Arabs like the 'Day of Thirst' five Years earlier, but in the End, through the inspirational Bravery of a few arab Leaders and the Actions of the Vanguard under al-harith Ibn Surayj and Qatan Ibn Qutayba, the Arabs broke through and reached Bukhara, which they laid Siege to."
