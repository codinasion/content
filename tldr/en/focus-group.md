short_summary: "Group interviewed to analyse opinions"
description: "A Focus Group is a Group Interview involving a small Number of demographically similar Participants. Their Reactions to specific researcher/evaluator-posed Questions are studied. Focus Groups are used in Market Research to understand better People's Reactions to Products or Services or Participants' Perceptions of shared Experiences. The Discussions can be guided or open. In Market Research Focus Groups can explore a Group's Response to a new Product or Service. As a Program Evaluation Tool they can elicit Lessons learned and Recommendations for Performance Improvement. The Idea is that the Researcher can learn about the Reactions of the Participants. If the Group Members are representative of a larger Population this Reaction may be expected to reflect the Views of that larger Population. Focus Groups thus constitute a Research or Evaluation Method that Researchers organize to collect qualitative Data through interactive and directed Discussions."
