title: "Blockhouse"
short_summary: "Type of fortification"
description: "A Blockhouse is a small Fortification usually consisting of one or more Rooms with Loopholes allowing its Defenders to fire in different Directions. It is usually an isolated Fort in the Form of a single Building, serving as a defensive strong Point against any Enemy that does not possess siege Equipment or, in modern Times, Artillery, Air Force and Cruise Missiles. A Fortification intended to resist these Weapons is more likely to qualify as a Fortress or a Redoubt or to be an underground Bunker in modern Times. However, a Blockhouse may also refer to a Room within a larger Fortification, usually a Battery or Redoubt."
