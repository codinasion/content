description: "The Combat: Woman pleading for the Vanquished is a large Oil Painting on Canvas by English Artist William Etty, first exhibited in 1825 and now in the National Gallery of Scotland. Inspired by the Elgin Marbles and intended by the Artist to provide a moral Lesson about the Beauty of Mercy it shows a near-nude Warrior whose Sword has broken forced to his Knees in Front of another near-nude Soldier who prepares to inflict. A woman, also near-nude, clutches the victorious warrior to beg him for mercy. Very unusually for a History Painting of the Period, the Combat does not depict a Scene from History, Literature or Religion and is not based on an existing Artwork, but is instead a Scene from the Artist's own Imagination."
