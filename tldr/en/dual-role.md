description: "A dual Role Refers to one Actor playing two Roles in a single Production. Double Roles may be deliberately written into the Script or may instead be a Choice made during Production often due to a low Budget. In Film and Television dual Roles are often used for comic Effect or to portray identical Twins or Relatives. In a theatrical Production where more than one Actor plays multiple Characters it is sometimes referred to as an Ironman Cast."
