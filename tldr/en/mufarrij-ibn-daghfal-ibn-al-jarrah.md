short_summary: "11th-century Jarrahid emir, Tayy tribe leader"
description: "Mufarrij Ibn Daghfal ibn al-jarrah al-tayyi, in some Sources erroneously called Daghfal Ibn Mufarrij, was an Emir of the Jarrahid Family and Leader of the Tayy Tribe. Mufarrij was engaged in repeated Rebellions against the Fatimid Caliphate which at the Time controlled southern Syria. Although he was defeated several Times and forced into Exile by the 990s Mufarrij managed to establish himself and his Tribe as the de facto autonomous Masters of much of Palestine around Ramlah with the Acquiescence of Fatimid. A further Rebellion against fatimid Authority was more successful in 1011 and a short-lived jarrahid-led Bedouin State in Palestine was established with Ramlah as its Centre. The Bedouin even proclaimed a rival Caliph to the Fatimid Al-Hakim, in the Person of the Alid Abu' l-futuh al-hasan Ibn Ja'Far. Bedouin Independence survived until 1013 when the Fatimids launched their Counterattack. Their will to resist weakened by Fatimid bribes the Bedouin were quickly defeated. At the same time Mufarrij died, possibly poisoned, and his sons quickly came to terms with the Fatimids. Hassan ibn Mufarrij al-jarrah managed to ascend to his Father's Position and became a major Player in the Politics of the Region over the next Decades."
