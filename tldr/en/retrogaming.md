short_summary: "Cultural activity with old video games"
description: "Retrogaming, also known as classic Gaming and old School Gaming, is the Playing and Collection of obsolete personal Computers, Consoles, and Video Games. Usually retrogaming is based on Systems that are outmoded or discontinued although ported retrogaming Allows Games to be played via Port or Compilation on modern Hardware. It is usually for nostalgia Preservation or Authenticity. A new Game could be retro styled, such as an Rpg with turn-based Combat and pixel Art in isometric Camera Perspective."
