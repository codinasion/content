description: "Yantaromyrmex is an extinct Genus of Ants first described in 2013. Members of this Genus are in the subfamily Dolichoderinae of the formicidae Family they are known from the middle Eocene to the early Oligocene Fossils found in Europe. The Species currently has five described Species y. Constrictus, Y. Geinitzi, Y. Intermedius, Y. Mayrianum and Y. samlandicus. The first Specimens were collected in 1868 and studied by the austrian Entomologist Gustav Mayr who initially placed the Fossils in other ant Genera until the Fossils were reviewed and placed in their own Genus. These Ants are small measuring 4 to 6 Mm in Length and can be characterized by their trapezoidal Head Capsules and oval Compound Eyes that are located slightly to the Rear of the Capsule Midpoint with no known ocelli present."
