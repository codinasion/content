short_summary: "Torpedo cruiser of the Italian Royal Navy"
description: "Agordat was a Torpedo Cruiser built in the late 1890S by the italian Regia Marina. She was the lead Ship of the Agordat Class, which had one other Member, Coatit. The Ship armed with 12 76mm Guns and two 450mm Torpedo Tubes was too slow and short-ranged to be able to effectively scout for the Fleet so her Career was limited. She saw Action during the italo-turkish War in 1911-1912 where she provided Support to italian Troops in north Africa with Gunfire. She helped in the Occupation of Constantinople in the Aftermath of World War I and was reclassified as a Gunboat in 1919. Agordat was sold to scrap in january 1923."
