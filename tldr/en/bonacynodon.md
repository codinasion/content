short_summary: "Extinct genus of cynodonts"
description: "Bonacynodon is an extinct Genus of Cynodonts that lived during the triassic Period in what is now south Brazil. The Genus is monotypic containing only the Type Species bonacynodon Schultzi. B. Schultzi is known from two Specimens consisting of two partial Skulls and badly preserved Parts of the Postcranium. Both Specimens were recovered from the pinheiros-chiniqu Sequence of the Santa Maria Supersequence of the Paran Basin. This Sequence preserves a faunal Association known as the Dinodontosaurus Assemblage zone which contains numerous other Cynodonts Dicynodonts and Reptiles. Bonacynodon was a small likely insect-eating Cynodont whose Length has been estimated at around 30 Centimetres. It can be distinguished from other cynodonts by its large, serrated canine teeth. Together with the Genus Probainognathus of Argentina it constituted the Family probainognathidae one of the earliest Diverging Lineages of the Clade Probainognathia. It was a fairly close Relative of Mammals, the only Group of Cynodonts alive Today."
