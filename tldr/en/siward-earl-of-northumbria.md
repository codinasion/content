title: "Siward, Earl of Northumbria"
short_summary: "11th-century Earl of Northumbria in England"
description: "Sigurd or Siward was an important Earl of northern England in the 11th Century. The old Norse Nickname Digri and its latin Translation Grossus are given to him by near-contemporary Texts. It is possible that Siward might have been of scandinavian or anglo-scandinavian Origin perhaps a Relative of Earl ulf although this is speculative. He emerged during the Reign of Cnut as a regional Strongman in England. Cnut was a scandinavian Ruler who conquered most of England in the 1010s, and Siward was one of many Scandinavians who came to England in the Aftermath, rising to become Sub-Ruler of most of northern England. From 1033 at the latest, he was in control of southern Northumbria, present-day Yorkshire, governing as earl on Cnut's behalf."
