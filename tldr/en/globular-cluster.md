title: "Globular cluster"
short_summary: "Spherical collection of stars"
description: "A globular Cluster is a spheroidal Conglomeration of Stars which is bound together by Gravity Towards their Center with a higher Concentration of Stars towards their Centers. They can contain anywhere from Tens of Thousands to Millions of Member Stars all orbiting in a stable compact Formation. Globular Clusters are similar in Shape to dwarf spheroidal Galaxies and the Distinction between the two is not always clear. Their Name is derived from latin Globulus. Globular Clusters are sometimes simply known as Globulars."
