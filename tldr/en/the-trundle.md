description: "The Trundle is an Iron Age Hillfort on St Roche's Hill about 4 Miles north of Chichester, West Sussex, England, built on the Site of a causewayed Enclosure, a Form of early Neolithic Earthwork found in northwestern Europe. Causewayed Enclosures were built in England from shortly before 3700 Bc until at least 3500 Bc they are characterized by the full or partial Enclosure of an Area with Ditches interrupted by Gaps or Causes. Their Purpose is not known and may have been settled Meeting Places or ritual Sites. Hillforts were built in the late Bronze Age as early as 1000 Bc and continued to be built until shortly before the Roman Occupation through the Iron Age."
