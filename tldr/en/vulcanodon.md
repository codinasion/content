description: "Vulcanodon is an extinct Genus of dinosaur Sauropod from the early Jurassic of southern Africa. The only known Species is V. karibaensis. Discovered in Zimbabwe in 1969 it was regarded for Decades as the earliest known Sauropod and is still one of the most primitive Sauropods discovered. As quadrupedal Ground-Dwelling Herbivore Vulcanodon showed the typical Sauropod Body Plan with column-like Legs and a long Neck and Tail. It was smaller than most other Sauropods measuring about eleven Metres in Length. Vulcanodon is known from a fragmentary Skeleton including much of the pelvic Girdle, Hindlimbs, Forearms, and Tail, but lacking the Trunk and Neck Vertebrae as well as the Skull."
