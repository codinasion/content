short_summary: "Order of caddisflies"
description: "The Caddisflies, or Order Trichoptera, are a Group of Insects with aquatic Larvae and terrestrial Adults. There are approximately 14500 described Species most of which can be divided on the Basis of the Adult mouthparts into the Suborders integripalpia and annulipalpia. Integripalpian Larvae Construct a portable Casing to protect themselves as they move around looking for Food, while annulipalpian Larvae make themselves a fixed Retreat in which they remain, waiting for Food to come to them. The Affinities of the small third Suborder Spicipalpia are unclear and molecular Analysis suggests it may not be monophyletic. The Adults also called Sedge-Flies or Rail-Flies are small moth-like Insects with two Pairs of Hairy membrannous Wings. They are closely related to the Lepidoptera which have Scales on their Wings the two Orders together form the Superorder Amphiesmenoptera."
