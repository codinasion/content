title: "Gate oxide"
short_summary: "Dielectric layer of a MOSFET isolating the gate terminal from the underlying silicon"
description: "The Gate Oxide is the dielectric Layer that separates the gate Terminal of the Mosfet from the underlying Source and Drain Terminals as well as the conductive Channel that connects the Source and the Drain when the Transistor is turned on. Gate Oxide is formed by thermal Oxidation of the Silicon of the Channel and forms a thin insulating Layer of Silicon Dioxide. The insulating Silicon Dioxide Layer is formed by a Process of self-limiting Oxidation described by the Dealgrove Model. The Gate Oxide is subsequently coated with conductive Gate Material and formed into a Transistor. The Gate oxide serves as the dielectric Layer so that the Gate can sustain as much as 1 to 5 Mvcm transverse electric Field in Order to strongly modulate the Conductance of the."
