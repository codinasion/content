title: "Cosmic microwave background"
short_summary: "Trace radiation from the early universe"
description: "The cosmic microwave background is microwave radiation that fills all space in the observable universe. It is a remnant that provides an important source of data on the primordial universe. The Space between Stars and Galaxies is nearly completely dark with a standard optical Telescope. However a sufficiently sensitive Radio Telescope detects a Faint Background Glow that is almost uniform and is not associated with any Star Galaxy or other Object. This Glow is strongest in the microwave Part of the Radio Spectrum. The accidental Discovery of the Cmb by the american Radio Astronomers arno Penzias and robert Wilson in 1965 was the Culmination of Work initiated in the 1940S."
