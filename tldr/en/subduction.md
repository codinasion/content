title: "Subduction"
short_summary: "A geological process at convergent tectonic plate boundaries where one plate moves under the other"
description: "Subduction is a geological Process in which the Oceanic Lithosphere and some Continental lithosphere are recycled into the Earth's Mantle at Convergent Boundaries. Where the oceanic Lithosphere of a tectonic Plate Converges with the less dense Lithosphere of a second Plate the heavier Plate Dives underneath the second Plate and Sinks into the Mantle. A Region where this Process occurs is known as a Subduction Zone and its Surface Expression is known as an arc-trench Complex. Most of the continental Crust of the Earth has formed through the Subduction Process. Rates of Subduction are typically measured in Centimeters per Year with Rates of Convergence as high as 11cmyear."
