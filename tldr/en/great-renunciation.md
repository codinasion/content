short_summary: "Event in the life of Gautama Buddha"
description: "The great Renunciation or great Departure is the traditional Term for Gautama Buddha's Departure from his Palace at Kapilavastu to live a Life as an ascetic. It is called the great Renunciation because it is seen as a great Sacrifice. Most accounts of this event can be found in post-canonical Buddhist texts from several Buddhist traditions, which are the most complete. These are, however, of a more mythological Nature than the early Texts. They exist in PƒÅli, Sanskrit and chinese Language."
