short_summary: "Tenth of the Twelve Shia Imams (828–868)"
description: "ʿalī Ibn Muḥammad Al-Hādī was a Descendant of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad and the tenth Imam in Twelver Shia, succeeding his Father, Muhammad Al-Jawad. Born in Medina in 828, Ali is known with the Titles al-hādī and al-naqī. After the Death of his Father in 835 most Followers of al-jawad readily accepted the Imamate of Ali who at that Time was still a Child. Drawing Parallels with the Story of young Jesus in the Quran, Twelver Sources attribute an exceptional Innate Knowledge to Ali which qualified him for the Imamate despite his young Age."
