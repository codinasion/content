short_summary: "1964 aviation accident"
description: "Flight 901a of Paradise Airlines was a scheduled Passenger Flight from san Jose municipal Airport to tahoe valley Airport in the united States. The lockheed l-049 Constellation serving the Flight crashed on 1 March 1964 during a heavy Snowstorm near genoa Peak on the eastern Side of Lake Tahoe killing all 85 Aboard and destroying the Plane. After the Crash Site was located the Recovery of the Wreckage and the Bodies of the Victims took most of a Month. Crash Investigators determined that the primary Cause of the Accident was the Pilot's Decision to attempt to land at tahoe Valley Airport when Visibility was too low due to clouds and Snowstorms in the Area. After aborting the Landing attempt the Flight Crew lost Awareness of the Plane's Position as it flew below the safe minimum Altitude in mountainous Terrain. The Pilot likely tried to fly through a low Mountain Pass in an Attempt to divert to the Reno Airport in Nevada and crashed into the left Shoulder of the Pass. At the Time it was the second-deadliest single-plane Crash in united States History and remains the worst Accident involving the lockheed l-049 Constellation."
