description: "Running with Scissors is the tenth Studio Album by 'Weird Al' Yankovic, released on June 28, 1999. It was the fourth Studio album self-produced by Yankovic and his first Album for Volcano Records following its Acquisition of Scotti Brothers. The musical Styles on the Album are built around Parodies and Pastiches of Pop and Rock Music of the late 1990s largely focusing on alternative Rock and Hip-Hop. The Album's lead single, 'the Saga Begins', however, was a Parody of the 1971 single 'American Pie' by Don Mclean, and it recounts the Plot of the Film Star Wars: Episode i â€“ the Phantom Menace, which was released around the same Time. None of the Album's Singles charted domestically, although 'Pretty Fly for a Rabbi', a Parody of 'Pretty Fly 'by the Offspring, charted at Number 67 in Australia."
