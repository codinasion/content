short_summary: "Battleship class of the German Imperial Navy"
description: "The Knig Class was a Group of four Dreadnought Battleships built in the early 1910s for the german Kaiserliche Marine. The Class comprised König, the Lead Ship, Grosser Kurfürst, Markgraf, and Kronprinz. The Design for the Ships was derived from the previous Kaiser Class using the same basic Hull but with a rearranged main Battery of ten 30. 5 Cm Guns in five twin-gun Turrets to improve the Guns' Firing Arcs. Instead of the staggered Wing Turrets used in the Kaisers the Knigs placed their main Guns using superfired Pairs fore and aft on the Centerline. Budget Constraints and the Need to begin Construction quickly to compete with Britain in the anglo-german naval War Race prevented further radical Changes. Diesel Engines were planned for the Ships but they could not be ready in Time so all four Ships were moving to steam Turbines for their Propulsion Systems."
