short_summary: "Guerilla gardening group from the 1970s"
description: "The green Guerillas are a Community Group of Gardeners Botanists and Planners who work to turn abandoned or empty Spaces in new York City into Gardens. The Group formed in the 1970s threw Seed Grenades into empty Lots and developed Community Gardens often without going through official Channels. It became particularly popular after the concerted Redevelopment of a dangerous trash-filled Space at the Corner of houston Street and Bowery in Manhattan. The resulting Media Coverage and Word of Mouth led the Group to expand its Activities from active Gardening to education Training and Support for a Number of Community Groups working on their own Gardens. Green Guerillas are credited with starting the Community Garden Movement and popularizing the Idea of Guerilla Gardening."
