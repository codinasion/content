title: "Jubilee coinage"
short_summary: "British coins depicting Queen Victoria"
description: "The Jubilee Coinage or Jubilee Head Coinage are british Coins with an Obverse featuring a Depiction of queen Victoria by Joseph Edgar Boehm. The Design was placed on the Silver and Gold Coinage circulating from 1887 and on the maundy Coinage from 1888. The Depiction of Victoria with a Crown which was seen as too small was widely mocked and was replaced in 1893. The Series saw the entire Issuance of the double Florin and, in 1888, the last Issue for Circulation of the Groat, or Fourpence Piece, although it was intended for Use in british Guiana. No Bronze coins with Jubilee Design were struck."
