title: "Ashur-dan III"
short_summary: "King of Assyria"
description: "Ashur-dan Iii was king of the neo-assyrian Empire from 773 Bc until his Death in 755 Bc. Ashur-Dan was a Son of adad-nirari Iii and succeeded his Brother Shalmaneser Iv as King. He ruled during a Period of assyrian Decline from which few Sources survive. As such his Reign, other than broad political Developments, is poorly known. At this Time the assyrian Officials were becoming increasingly powerful relative to the King and at the same Time the Enemies of Assyria became more. Ashur-Dan's Reign was particularly difficult as he faced two Outbreaks of Plague and five of his 18 Years as King were dedicated to putting down Revolts."
