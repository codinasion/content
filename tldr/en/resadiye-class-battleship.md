short_summary: "Royal Navy's Reşadiye-class of two dreadnought battleships"
description: "The Readiye Class was a Group of two dreadnought Battleships ordered by the Ottoman Empire from Britain in the 1910s. The Design of the Ships was based on the british King George v Battleships although it incorporated several significant Improvements. They carried the same 13. 5-inch main Battery Guns as the british Ships, but their secondary Battery consisted of 6-inch Guns, compared to the british Vessels' 4-inch Pieces. The first Ship, Reşadiye, was laid down in 1911 and completed in August 1914, shortly after the Outbreak of World War i ; she was seized by the british Royal Navy and commissioned as Hms Erin. The second Ship fatih Sultan mehmed had only been ordered in april 1914 and very little Work was done by the Beginning of the War so she was quickly broken up for Scrap."
