description: "Caroline Pafford Miller was an american Novelist. She collected the Folktales Stories and archaic Dialects of the rural Communities she visited in her Home State Georgia in the late 1920s and early 1930s and wove them into her first novel Lamb in his Bosom for which she won the 1934 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and the 1935 french literary Award. Her Success as the first georgian Winner of the Fiction Prize inspired Macmillan Publishers to seek out more southern Writers this led to the Discovery of Margaret Mitchell whose first Novel gone with the Wind also won a Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1937. Miller's Story of the Struggles of nineteenth-century south Georgia Pioneers found a new Audience in 1993 when Lamb in his Bosom was reprinted one Year after her Death.
