short_summary: "Uncompleted battleship of the United States Navy"
description: "The uss Kentucky was an unfinished Battleship intended to be the last Ship of the iowa Class. Hull Bb-66 was originally meant to be the second Ship in the Battleships of the Montana Class. However, the urgent need for more warships at the outbreak of World War II and the U. S. Navy's Experiences in the Pacific Theater led it to conclude that rather than Battleships larger and more heavily armed than the iowa Class it quickly needed more fast Battleships of that Class to escort the new Essex-Class Aircraft Carriers that were built. As a Result the Hulls bb-65 and bb-66 were reordered and laid down in 1942 as Battleships of the iowa Class."
