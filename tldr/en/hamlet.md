description: "The Tragedy of Hamlet Prince of Denmark often shortened to hamlet is a Tragedy written by William Shakespeare sometime between 1599 and 1601.

Set in Denmark the Play depicts prince Hamlet and his Attempts to exact Revenge against his Uncle Claudius who murdered Hamlet's Father in Order to steal his Throne and marry Hamlet's Mother. Hamlet is considered among the 'most powerful and influential Tragedies in the english Language', with a Story capable of 'seemingly endless Retelling and Adaptation by Others'. It is widely considered one of the greatest Plays of all Time. Three different early Versions of the Play are extant: the First Quarto ; the Second Quarto ; and the First Folio. Each Version includes Lines and Passages missing from the other Versions."
