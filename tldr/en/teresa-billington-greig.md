description: "Teresa Billington-Greig was a british Suffragette who was one of the Founders of the Women's Freedom League in 1907. She had left the Women's social and political Union also known as Wspu because she considered the Leadership of Emmeline Pankhurst and her Daughters too autocratic. She was appointed in 1904 by the Wspu as the Travel Speaker of the Organisation. Billington-Greig was tasked with drumming up Support for the Wspu Branches in Scotland in Autumn 1906. During Debate in the House of Commons she unveiled a Banner entitled Votes for Women in the Ladies gallery on April 25 1906. In June 1906 she was arrested in a Fracas outside the Seat of the Chancellor of the Exchequer H. H. Asquith's Home, and as a Result was the first Suffragette to be incarcerated in Holloway Prison."
