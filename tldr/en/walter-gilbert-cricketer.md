short_summary: "English Amateur cricketer (1853–1924)"
description: "Walter Raleigh Gilbert was an english Amateur Cricketer who played First-Class Cricket for Middlesex and Gloucestershire between 1873 and 1886. A Cousin of W. G. Grace, he played for Gloucestershire when, dominated by the Grace Family, it was the leading County. Gilbert's best Season was 1876 when he scored 205 not out for the County but subsequently was less successful. Closely connected with the United South of England Eleven, a professional Touring Team of which he eventually became Secretary, Gilbert was financially affected by a declining Interest in such Teams. With insufficient Earnings to continue as an Amateur he became a Professional in 1886 but played only one Match before he was caught stealing from Teammates in a minor Match that ended his first-class Career. After serving a 28-day Jail Term Gilbert moved to canada where he worked for the Land Titles Office in calgary while remaining a prominent Cricketer. He died aged 70 in 1924, but for nearly 60 Years after his Death, there seemed to be a Conspiracy of Silence over his Fate."
