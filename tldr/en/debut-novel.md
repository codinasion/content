short_summary: "First full-length work of fiction by an author"
description: "A Debut Novel is the first Novel a Writer Publishes. Debut Novels are often the first Opportunity for the Author to make an Impact on the Publishing Industry and therefore the Success or Failure of a Debut Novel can impact the Ability of the Author to publish in the Future. However first-time Novelists often struggle to find a Publisher without a previous published Reputation such as Publication in Nonfiction Magazines or literary Journals."
