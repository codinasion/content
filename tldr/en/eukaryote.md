description: "The Eukaryotes constitute the Domain of eukarya Organisms whose Cells have a membrane-bound Nucleus. All Animals, Plants, Fungi, and many unicellular Organisms are Eukaryotes. They constitute a major Group of Life Forms alongside the two Groups of Prokaryotes: the Bacteria and the Archaea.
