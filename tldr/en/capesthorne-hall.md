short_summary: "Manor in Cheshire, England"
description: "Capesthorne Hall is a Country House near the Village of Siddington, Cheshire, England. The House and its private Chapel were built in the early 18thcentury replacing an earlier Hall and Chapel nearby. They were built by William Smith and his Son Francis to neoclassical Designs. Later in the 18thcentury the House was extended by the Addition of an Orangery and a Study. In the 1830s the House was remodelled by Edward Blore ; the Work included the Addition of an Extension and a Frontage in Jacobean Style, and joining the central Block to the Service Wings. In about 1837 the Orangery was replaced by a large Conservatory designed by Joseph Paxton. The main Part of the House was virtually destroyed by Fire in 1861. It was rebuilt by Anthony Salvin, who generally followed Blore's Designs but made Modifications to the Front, rebuilt the Back of the House in Jacobean Style, and altered the Interior. Later in the 19thcentury there were further Alterations including a Remodelling of the Saloon. During the second World War the Hall was used by the red Cross but a subsequent Deterioration caused a Restoration."
