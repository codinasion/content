short_summary: "DNA inside the nucleus of eukaryotic cells"
description: "Nuclear Dna or nuclear deoxyribonucleic Acid is the Dna contained in each Cell Nucleus of an eukaryotic Organism. It encodes for the majority of the genome in eukaryotes, with mitochondrial DNA and plastid DNA coding for the rest. It adheres to mendelian Inheritance, with Information coming from two Parents, one Male and one femaleâ€”rather than matrilineally as in mitochondrial Dna."
