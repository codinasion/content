short_summary: "Atlantic tropical storm in 2001"
description: "Tropical Storm Dean was a strong tropical Storm that affected at least twelve Islands along its Path from the tropical atlantic Ocean to the East of atlantic Canada in August 2001. Dean developed over the lesser Antilles on august 22 from a tropical Wave and was initially expected to intensify further to reach Hurricane Status. However, strong Wind shear quickly weakened Dean to cause it to dissipate on August 23. The Remnants turned north and redeveloped on august 26 to the North of Bermuda. Dean steadily strengthened while moving to the Northeast and peaked just below Hurricane Status on August 27 about 465 Miles southwest of Newfoundland. The Storm subsequently weakened over Cooler Waters and became extratropical on August 28th."
