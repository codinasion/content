title: "Oort cloud"
short_summary: "Distant planetesimals in the Solar System"
description: "The Oort cloud, sometimes called the Öpik–Oort cloud, is theorized to be a vast cloud of icy planetesimals surrounding the Sun at distances ranging from 2,000 to 200,000 AU. The Concept of such a Cloud was proposed in 1950 by the dutch Astronomer Jan Oort in whose Honor the Idea was named. Oort proposed that the Bodies in this Cloud Replenish and keep constant the Number of long-period Comets entering the Inner solar System where they eventually are consumed and destroyed during close Approaches to the Sun."
