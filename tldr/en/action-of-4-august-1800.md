description: "The Action of August 4 1800 was a highly unusual Naval Engagement which took Place off the brazilian Coast during the french Revolutionary Wars. A french Frigate Force that had been raiding british Trade off West Africa approached and attempted to attack a Convoy of valuable east Indianmen two Ships sailing for Botany Bay and a Whaler Sailing for the south seas Whale Fishing. The small british Ship of the Line Hms Belliqueux escorted the Convoy which otherwise had to rely on the Ships' individual Armament to protect. Due to their large Size the East Indians could be mistaken at a Distance for Ships of the Line and french Commander commodore jean-franois Landolphe was unnerved when the Convoy formed a Line of Battle. Supposing his Target to be a Fleet of powerful Warships he turned to escape and the british Commander, Captain Rowley Bulteel, immediately ordered a Pursuit. To preserve the Impression of Warships he ordered four of his most powerful east Indiamen to join the Chase."
