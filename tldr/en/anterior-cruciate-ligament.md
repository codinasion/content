description: "The anterior Cruciate Ligament is one of two Cruciate Ligaments in the human Knee. The two Ligaments are also called Cruciform Ligaments as they are arranged in a crossed Formation. In the quadruped Stifle Joint it is also referred to as the cranial Cruciate Ligament based on its anatomical Position. The Term Cruciate Refers to a Cross. The Name is fitting because the Acl crosses the posterior Cruciate Ligament to form an X. It is composed of strong, fibrous material and assists in controlling excessive motion. This is done by restricting the Mobility of the joint. The anterior Cruciate Ligament is one of the four main Ligaments of the Knee, providing 85 % of the restraining Force to anterior tibial Displacement at 30 and 90Â° of Knee Flexion. The Acl is the most injured Ligament of the four Found in the Knee."
