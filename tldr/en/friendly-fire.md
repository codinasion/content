title: "Friendly fire"
short_summary: "Accidental attack on friendly forces"
description: "In military Terms friendly Fire or Fratricide is an Attack by Belligerent or neutral Forces against friendly Troops while attempting to attack enemy Targets. Examples include misidentifying the Target as hostile, Cross-Fire while engaging an Enemy, long Range ranging Errors or Inaccuracy. Accidental Fire not intended to attack enemy/hostile Targets, and deliberate Firing on one's own Troops for disciplinary Reasons, is not called friendly Fire, and neither is unintentional Harm to civilian or neutral Targets, which is sometimes referred to as collateral Damage. Training Accidents and Bloodless Incidents also do not qualify as friendly Fire in Terms of Casualty Reporting."
