short_summary: "Breed of cattle"
description: "North american piedmontese Cattle are a Breed of domestic Beef Cattle originating from an imported Herd of select italian purebred Piedmontes. The Breeding breeding Stock Foundation was first imported from Italy into Canada in 1979 and then in the early 1980s to the united States. Piedmontese Cattle are distinguished by a naturally occurring unique Gene identified as the Myostatin allele Mutation or inactive Myostatin Gene. Myostatin Inhibits muscle Growth while an inactive Gene has the opposite Effect. Purebred Piedmontese are homozygous which means there are two identical Alleles present for this unique Gene. Research indicates the Presence of the allele Mutation Myostatin produces morphological Characteristics unique to the Breed such as double-muscling Meat Tenderness reduced fat Content and high Yield. According to the north american Piedmontese Association they are the first Breed Registry to base animal Registration Requirements on the Presence of this specific Gene which can easily verified by Dna testing."
