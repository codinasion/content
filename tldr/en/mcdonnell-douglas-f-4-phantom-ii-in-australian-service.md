description: "The Royal australian Air Force operated between 1970 and 1973 24 Mcdonnell Douglas f-4e Phantomii Fighter Bomber Aircraft in the Ground Attack Role. The Phantoms were leased from the United States Air Force as an interim measure owing to delays in the delivery of the RAAF's 24 General Dynamics F-111C bombers. The F-4Es were considered successful in this Role but the Government did not accept a Proposal from the Raaf to retain the Aircraft after the f-111 entered Service in 1973."
