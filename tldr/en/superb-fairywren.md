short_summary: "Species of bird"
description: "The splendid Fairywren is a passerine Bird in the maluridae Family of australasian Wrens and is common and familiar across south-eastern Australia. It is a sedentary and territorial Species, also exhibiting a high Degree of sexual Dimorphism ; the Male in breeding Plumage has a striking bright Blue Forehead, ear Coverts, Mantle, and Tail, with a black Mask and black or dark blue Throat. Non-breeding Males, Females and Juveniles are predominantly grey-brown in Colour ; this gave the early Impression that Males were polygamous, as all dull-coloured Birds were taken for Females. Six Subspecies Groups are recognized: three larger and Darker Forms from Tasmania, Flinders and King Island respectively, and three smaller and paler Forms from Mainland Australia and Kangaroo Island."
