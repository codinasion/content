title: "Jessye Norman"
short_summary: "American opera singer (1945–2019)"
description: "Jessye Mae Norman was an american Opera Singer and Recitalist. She was able to perform dramatic Soprano Roles, but did not limit herself to that Voice Type. A commanding Presence on operatic, concert and recital Stages, Norman was associated with Roles including Beethoven's Leonore, Wagner's Sieglinde and Kundry, Berlioz's Cassandre and Didon, and Bartók's Judith. The New York Times Music critic Edward Rothstein described her Voice as a 'grand Mansion of Sound', and wrote that 'it has enormous Dimensions, reaching Backward and Upward. It opens onto unexpected Vistas. It contains sunlit Rooms, narrow Passageways, cavernous Halls."
