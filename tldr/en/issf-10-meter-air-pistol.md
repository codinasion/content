description: "The 10 Meter Air Pistol is an Olympic shooting Event governed by the international Shooting Sports Federation. It is similar to 10 Meter Air Rifle in that it is shot with 4. 5 mm Caliber Air Guns at a Distance of 10 Metres, and that the Match consists of a Qualification Round of 60 Competition Shots within 75 Minutes. If an electronic Scoring System is not available 15 Minutes are added to the Time Limit. Competitors are permitted to shoot an unlimited Number of Shots during the 15-minute Preparation and Sighting Time. Along with the 50-meter Pistol it is considered a Precision shooting Event. Thus in both Competitions numerous Shooters compete."
