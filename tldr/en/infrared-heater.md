title: "Infrared heater"
short_summary: "Device designed to create radiative heat"
description: "An infrared Heater or Heat Lamp is a heating Appliance containing a high Temperature Emitter that sends electromagnetic Radiation to a Cooler Object. Depending on the Temperature of the Emitter the Wavelength of the Peak of infrared Radiation ranges from 750nm to 1mm. No Contact between the Emitter and the cool Object is necessary for Energy Transfer. Infra-red Heaters can operate in Vacuum or in atmosphere."
