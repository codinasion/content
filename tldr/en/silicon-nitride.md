title: "Silicon nitride"
short_summary: "Compound of silicon and nitrogen"
description: "Silicon Nitride is a chemical Compound of the Elements Silicon and Nitrogen. Si3N4 is the most thermodynamically stable and commercially important of the Silicon Nitrides and the Term Silicon nitride commonly Refers to this specific Composition. It is a white high Melting-Point Solid that is relatively chemically inert and is attacked by Dilute Hf and hot H3Po4. It is very hard. It has a high thermal stability with strong optical nonlinearities for all-optical applications."
