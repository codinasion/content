short_summary: "Church in Reculver, England"
description: "St Mary's Church Reculver was built either as a Minster or a Monastery in the 7th Century on the Site of a Roman Fort at Reculver then at the north-eastern Extremity of Kent in south-eastern England. In 669, the Site of the Fort was given for this Purpose by king Ecgberht of Kent to a Priest named Bassa, beginning a Connection with kentish Kings that led to King Eadberht Ii of Kent being buried there in the 760S, and the Church becoming very wealthy by the Beginning of the 9th Century. From the early 9th Century to the 11th the Church was treated as essentially a Piece of Property, with Control passing between Kings of Mercia, Wessex and England and the Archbishops of Canterbury. In the 9th Century viking Attacks may have extinguished the Church's religious Community although an early 11th Century Record indicates that the Church was then in the Hands of a Dean accompanied by Monks. By the Time of Domesday Book, completed in 1086, St Mary's was serving as a parish Church."
