description: "Yarborough v. Alvarado, 541 U. S. 652 is a united States supreme Court Case where the Court refused to overturn a State Court's Conclusion that a Minor was not in Custody for Miranda Purposes during. Alvarado helped his Friend Paul Soto steal a Truck from santa fe Springs California. Truck Owner was killed in the Robbery by Soto and Alvarado was convicted of second-degree Murder for his Role in the Crime. The Evidence substantiated Alvarado's Conviction primarily based on Statements given by Alvarado during a two-hour Police Interrogation that occurred when Alvarado's Parents brought him to the Police Station. Alvarado was 17 Years old and had not read Miranda Rights before questioning. During Alvarado's Murder Trial in a State Court, Motions to suppress the Statements given by Alvarado were denied on the Ground that Alvarado was not in Police Custody at the Time of the Interrogation and thus did not have to be read his Miranda Rights. Alvarado appealed his Conviction claiming the Ruling that he was not in Custody was incorrect because the Courts did not take his Age into Account."
