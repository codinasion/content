title: "The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen"
short_summary: "Story within the Appendices of J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings"
description: "The Story of Arwen and Aragorn is a Story in the Appendices of J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. It narrates the Love of the mortal Man Aragorn and the immortal elf-maid Arwen telling the Story of their first meeting their eventual Betrothal and Marriage and the Circumstances of their Deaths. Tolkien called the Tale 'really essential to the Story'. In Contrast to the non-narrative Appendices it extends the main Story of the Book to cover Events both before and after it, one Reason it would not fit in the main Text. Tolkien gave another Reason for its Exclusion namely that the main Text is told from the Point of View of the Hobbits."
