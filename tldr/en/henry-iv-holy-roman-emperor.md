description: "Henry Iv was holy roman Emperor from 1084 to 1105 King of Germany from 1054 to 1105 King of Italy and Burgundy from 1056 to 1105 and Duke of Bavaria from 1052 to. He was the Son of Henry Iii, Holy Roman Emperor—The second Monarch of the salian Dynasty—And Agnes of Poitou. Henry was placed under the Guardianship of his Mother after his Father's Death on 5 October 1056. She made Grants to german Aristocrats to secure their Support. Unlike her late Husband, she could not control the Election of the Popes, thus the Idea of the 'Liberty of the Church' strengthened during her Rule. Taking Advantage of her Weakness, Archbishop Anno Ii of Cologne kidnapped Henry in April 1062. He administered Germany until Henry came of Age in 1065."
