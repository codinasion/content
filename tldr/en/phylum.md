title: "Phylum"
short_summary: "High level taxonomic rank for organisms sharing a similar body plan"
description: "In Biology, a Phylum is a Level of Classification or taxonomic Rank below Kingdom and above Class. Traditionally the Term Division was used in botany instead of Phylum although the international Code of Nomenclature for algae Fungi and Plants accepts the Terms as Equivalent. Depending on Definitions, the animal Kingdom Animalia contains about 31 Phyla, the Plant Kingdom Plantae contains about 14 Phyla, and the fungus Kingdom Fungi contains about 8 Phyla. Current Research in Phylogenetics Uncovers the Relationships between Phyla within larger Clades like Ecdysozoa and Embryophyta."
