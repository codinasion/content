short_summary: "4th-century BC Greek courtesan"
description: "Phryne was an ancient Greek Hetaira. From Thespiae in Boeotia, she was active in Athens, where she became one of the wealthiest Women in Greece. She is best known for her Impiety Trial where she was defended by the Orator Hypereides. According to legend she was acquitted after baring her Breasts to the Jury though the historical Accuracy of this Episode is doubtful. She also modeled for the Artists Apelles and Praxiteles, and the Aphrodite of Knidos was based on her. Typically ignored during the Renaissance artistic Interest in Phryne began to grow from the End of the eighteenth Century her Trial was famously depicted by jean-lon Grme in the Painting Phryne before the Areopag."
