She is best known for her Impiety Trial where she was defended by the Orator Hypereides. According to legend she was acquitted after baring her Breasts to the Jury though the historical Accuracy of this Episode is doubtful. She also modeled for the Artists Apelles and Praxiteles, and the Aphrodite of Knidos was based on her.
