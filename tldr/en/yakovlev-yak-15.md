short_summary: "Soviet first-generation turbojet fighter"
description: "The yakovlev Yak-15 was a first Generation soviet Turbojet Fighter developed immediately after World War Ii by the Yakovlev Design Bureau. The main Fuselage was that of the yakovlev yak-3 Piston Engine Fighter modified to mount a reverse-engineered german Junkers jumo 004. The Yak-15 and the swedish Saab 21r were the only two Jets to successfully be converted from Piston to Production Power. 280 Aircraft were built in 1947. Although nominally a Fighter it was mainly used to train Pilots with Piston Engines to fly Jets."
