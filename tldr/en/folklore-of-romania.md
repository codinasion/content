short_summary: "Local tales and legends from Romania"
description: "The folklore of Romania is the collection of traditions of the Romanians. A Feature of romanian Culture is the special Relationship between Folklore and learned Culture determined by two Factors. The rural Character of romanian Communities led first to an exceptionally vital and creative traditional Culture. Folk Works were the main literary Genre until the 18th Century. They were both a Source of Inspiration for cultivated Creators and a structural Model. Second, for a long Time learned Culture was governed by official and social Commands and developed around Courts of Princes and Boyars, as well as in Monasteries."
