short_summary: "Family of flowering plants in order Liliales, including lilies"
description: "The liliaceae Family contains about 15 Genera and 610 Species of flowering Plants within the Liliales Order. They are perennial herbaceous and monocotyledonous Geophytes often bulbous. Plants in this Family evolved with a fair Amount of morphological Diversity despite genetic Similarity. Common Characteristics include large Flowers with Parts arranged in Threes: with six colored or patterned petaloid Tepals arranged in two Whorls, six Stamens and a superior Ovary. The Leaves are linear in Shape with their Veins usually parallel to the Edges single and arranged on the Stem or in a Rosette at the Base. Most Species are grown from Bulbs although some have Rhizomes. First described in 1789 the lily Family became a paraphyletic Catchall Group of lilioid Monocots that did not fit into other Families and included a great Number of Genera now included in other Families and in some Cases in other Orders. So many Sources and Descriptions associated with liliaceae Deal with the broader Sense of the Family."
