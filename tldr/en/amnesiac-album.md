short_summary: "2001 studio album by Radiohead"
description: "Amnesiac is the fifth studio album by the English rock band Radiohead, released on 30 May 2001 by EMI. It was recorded with Producer Nigel godrich in the same Sessions as Radiohead's previous Album kid a. Radiohead split the Project in two as they felt it was too dense for a double Album. As with Kid A, Amnesiac incorporates Influences from electronic Music, 20th-century classical Music, Jazz and Krautrock. The final Song Life in a Glasshouse is a Collaboration with Jazz Trumpeter humphrey Lyttelton and his Band."
