short_summary: "Old English fortification or fortified settlement"
description: "A Burh or Burg was an anglo-saxon Fortification or fortified Settlement. In the 9th Century Raids and Invasions by Vikings prompted alfred the great to develop a Network of Burhs and Roads to use against such Attackers. Some were new Constructions Others were situated on the Site of Iron Age Hillforts or Roman Forts and used Materials from the original Fortifications. As at Lundenburh, many were also situated on Rivers: this facilitated internal Lines of Supply while aiming to restrict Access to the Interior of the Kingdom for Attackers in shallow-draught Vessels such as Longships."
