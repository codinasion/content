description: "The delphian Club was an early american Literary Club between 1816 and 1825. Delphians like John Neal were the focal Point of Baltimore's literary Community and were prodigious Authors and Editors. The Group of mostly Lawyers and Doctors gathered weekly to Share Refreshments and facetious Stories, with many of their Works being published in the Portico Magazine. The Club's Structure and Terminology were inspired by classical Antiquity and comical Verbosity. Sixteen Men claimed Membership during the Club's nine-year Run with no more than nine served at a Time. In his unpublished Tales of the Folio Club in the 1830s Edgar Allan Poe satirised the Group."
