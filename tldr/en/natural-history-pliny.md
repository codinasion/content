short_summary: "Encyclopedia on Nature, Written by pliny the elder."
description: "Natural History is a latin Work by pliny the Elder. The largest single Work to have survived from the Roman Empire to the modern Day, the Natural History compiles Information gleaned from other ancient Authors. Despite the Work's Title, its subject Area is not limited to what is Today Understood by natural History ; Pliny himself defines his Scope as 'the natural World, or Life'. It is encyclopaedia in Scope but its Structure is not like that of a modern Encyclopedia. It is the only Work by Pliny to have survived, and the last that he published. At the Time of his Death during the Eruption of Vesuvius in Ad 79 he published the first 10 Books in Ad 77 but had not made a final Revision of the Remainder. The Rest was posthumously published by Pliny's nephew pliny the Younger."
