short_summary: "Lineage of cells that evades senescence and continues dividing"
description: "An immortalised Cell Line is a Population of Cells from a multicellular Organism which would normally not proliferate indefinitely but have evaded normal cellular Senescence due to Mutation and can instead keep undergoing Division. Therefore the Cells can be grown in Vitro for longer Periods. The Mutations necessary for Immortality can occur naturally or be intentionally induced for experimental Purposes. Immortal Cell Lines are an important Tool for Research into the Biochemistry and Cell Biology of multicellular Organisms. Immortalized Cell Lines have also found Applications in Biotechnology."
