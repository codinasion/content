title: "Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymers"
short_summary: "Light, strong and rigid composite material"
description: "Carbon-Fiber reinforced Thermoplastics known as Carbon Fiber Carbon Composite or just Carbon are extremely strong and light fiber-reinforced Plastics that contain Carbon Fibers. Cfrps can be expensive to manufacture but are commonly used wherever high strength-to-weight Ratio and Stiffness are required such as Aerospace Superstructures of Ships automotive civil Engineering Sports Equipment and an increasing Number of Consumer and technical Applications."
