short_summary: "Trust that comes into force after death"
description: "In English Law, secret Trusts are a Class of Trust defined as an Arrangement between a Testator and a Trustee, made to come into Force after Death, that aims to benefit a Person without having been written in a formal will. The Property is given in the will to the Trustee and then he would be expected to pass it on to the real Beneficiary. For these to be valid, the Person seeking to enforce the Trust must prove that the Testator intended to form a Trust, that this Intention was communicated to the Trustee, and that the Trustee accepted his Office. There are two Types of secret Trust fully secret and Half secret. A fully secret Trust is one with no Mention in the will whatsoever. In the Case of a half-secret Trust, the Face of the will names the Trustee as Trustee, but does not give the Trust's Terms, including the Beneficiary. The most important Difference lies in the Communication of the Trust the Terms of a half-secret Trust must be communicated to the Trustee before the Execution of the will whereas in the Case of a fully secret Trust the Terms may be communicated after the Execution of the will as long as this is before."
