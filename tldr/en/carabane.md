description: "Carabane, also known as Karabane, is an Island and a Village located in the extreme South-West of Senegal, in the Mouth of the Casamance River. This relatively recent geological Formation consists of a Shoal and Alluvium to which Soil is added through Accumulation in the Branches and Roots of Mangrove Trees which cover most of the Island. Carabane has a tropical Climate along with the Rest of the Ziguinchor Region that oscillates between a dry Season and a Wet Season. The Island was once considered an arid Place where no useful Plants were likely to grow but it now supports several Types of Fruit Trees the most common of which are Mangoes and Oranges. Although the nearby Basse Casamance national Park and kalissaye avifaunal Reserve have been closed for Years because of the Casamance Conflict Carabane has continued to attract Ornithologists interested in its wide Variety of Birds. Various Species of Fish are plentiful on the Island but there are very few Mammals."
