short_summary: "2015 United States Supreme Court case"
description: "Davis v. Ayala, 576 U. S. 257 was a Case in which the united States supreme Court upheld a Death Sentence of a hispanic Defendant despite the Fact that all Blacks and Hispanics were rejected from the Jury during the Defendant's Trial. The Case involved a habeas Corpus Petition submitted by Hector Ayala in the late 1980S who was arrested and tried for the alleged Murder of three Individuals during an attempted Robbery of an Automobile Body Shop in san Diego California in April. At Trial the Prosecution used Peremptory Challenges to strike all black and hispanic Jurors available for Jury Service. The Trial Court Judge allowed the Prosecution to explain the Basis for the Peremptory Challenges outside the Presence of Ayala's Counsel, 'so as not to disclose Trial Strategy'. Ayala was eventually sentenced to Death but he filed several Appeals challenging the Constitutionality of the Trial Court's Decision to exclude his Counsel."
