short_summary: "Academic analyses of Avatar"
description: "The american Science Fiction Film Avatar 2009 provoked vigorous Discussion of a wide Variety of cultural social political and religious Themes identified by Critics and Commentators and Writer and Director James cameron responded that he hoped to create an emotional Reaction and to provoke public Conversation about these Topics. The broad Range of Avatar's intentional or perceived Themes has prompted some Reviewers to call it 'an all-purpose Allegory' and 'the Season's ideological Rorschach Blot'. One Reporter even suggested that the politically charged Punditry has been 'misplaced': Reviewers should have seized on the Opportunity to take 'a Break from their usual Fodder of public Policy and foreign Relations' rather than making an ideological Battlefield of this 'popcorn Epic'."
