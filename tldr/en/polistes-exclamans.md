short_summary: "Species of wasp"
description: "Polistes Exclamans guinea Paper Wasp is a social Wasp and is Part of the vespidae Family of the Hymenoptera. It is found throughout the united States mexico the Bahamas Jamaica and Parts of Canada. Due to solitary nest founding by queens, P. Exclamans has extended its Area in the last few Decades and now covers the eastern Half of the united States as well as Part of the northern Region of new England. This Expansion is typically attributed to changing Climate and Temperatures. P. Exclamans has three specific Castes, including Males, Workers, and Queens, but the Dominance Hierarchy is further distinguished by Age. The older the Wasp is, the higher it is in ranking within the Colony. In most P. Exclamans Nests there is one Queen who lays all Eggs in the Colony. The physiological Similarities between the Worker and the queen Castes have led to Experiments attempting to distinguish the Characteristics of these two Castes and how they are determined although Males have easily identifiable physiological Characteristics. Since P. Exclamans live in relatively small, open Combed Nests, they are often subject to Predators and Parasites, such as Chalcoela Iphitalis, Elasmus Polistis, and Birds. P. Exclamans have defensive and Recognition Strategies that help protect them from Predators and Parasites."
