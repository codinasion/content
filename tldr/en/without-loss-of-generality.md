title: "Without loss of generality"
short_summary: "Expression in mathematics"
description: "Without Loss of Generality is a commonly used Expression in Mathematics. The Term is used to indicate the Assumption that follows is chosen arbitrarily, narrowing the Premise to a particular Case, but does not affect the Validity of the Proof in general. Other Cases are sufficiently similar to the One presented that their Validation follows essentially the same Logic. As a Result, once a Proof is given for the particular Case, it is trivial to adapt it to prove the Conclusion in all other Cases."
