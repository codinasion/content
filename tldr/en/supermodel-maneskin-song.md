description: "Supermodel is a Song by the italian Rock Band Mneskin. It was released on may 13 2022 through Epic Records and sony Music as the second single from their third Studio Album Rush! . It was written by Måneskin Members Damiano David, Victoria De Angelis, Thomas Raggi and Ethan Torchio, alongside Justin Tranter and the Song's Producers Max Martin, Rami Yacoub and Sylvester Sivertsen. It is a california-inspired Pop Rock Track with a Grunge Intro. Inspired by the Group's Stay in Los Angeles, they created a fictional Character named 'Supermodel', and the Song Talks about her life–what she does for a Living, how she spends her Life and that she would not love Anyone back. The single was mostly met with positive Reviews ; however, in a Review posted by Jenesaispop, Max Martin's Production was deemed as Damaging to the Band's Personality."
