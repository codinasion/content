It is a california-inspired Pop Rock Track with a Grunge Intro. Inspired by the Group's Stay in Los Angeles, they created a fictional Character named 'Supermodel', and the Song Talks about her life–what she does for a Living, how she spends her Life and that she would not love Anyone back. The single was mostly met with positive Reviews ; however, in a Review posted by Jenesaispop, Max Martin's Production was deemed as Damaging to the Band's Personality."
