short_summary: "Stack-based method for clustering"
description: "In the Theory of Cluster Analysis the nearest Neighbor Chain Algorithm is an Algorithm that can speed up several Methods for agglomerative hierarchical Clustering. These are Methods that take a Collection of Points as Input and create a Hierarchy of Clusters of Points repeatedly merging Pairs of smaller Clusters to form larger Clusters. The Clustering Methods used by the nearest-neighbor Chain Algorithm include Wards complete-linkage Clustering and Single-Linkage clustering all Work by repeatedly merging the closest two Clusters but use different Definitions of the Distance between Clusters. The Cluster Distances for which the Nearest-Neighbor Chain Algorithm Works are called reducible and are characterized by a simple Inequality among certain Cluster Distances."
