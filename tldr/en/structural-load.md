title: "Structural load"
short_summary: "Forces, deformations, or accelerations applied to a structure or its components"
description: "A structural Load or structural Action is a Force of Deformation or Acceleration applied to structural Elements. A load causes stress, deformation, and displacement in a structure. Structural Analysis a Discipline in Engineering analyses the Effects of Loads on Structures and structural Elements. Excess Load can cause structural Failure so this should be considered and controlled during the Design of a Structure. Specific mechanical Structures such as Aircraft satellites Rockets Space Stations Ships and Submarines are subject to their own particular structural Loads and Actions. Engineers typically evaluate structural Loads based on published Regulations Contracts or Specifications. Accepted technical Standards are used for Acceptance Testing and Inspection."
