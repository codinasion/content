description: "Nestor Apollonovich Lakoba was an Abkhaz communist leader. After the russian Revolution Lakoba helped establish bolshevik Power in Abkhazia and served as Head of Abkhazia after its Conquest by the Bolshevik red Army in 1921. During his Time in Power Lakoba saw that Abkhazia was given autonomy as the socialist soviet Republic of Abkhazia within the Ussr.
