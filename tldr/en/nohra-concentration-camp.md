The Camp was administered by the interior Minister of Thuringia. The Inmates were exclusively Communists and included half the communist Party Group in the thuringian State Parliament. Prisoners were not forced to work or systematically abused but had to suffer from poor Hygiene Conditions and had no Beds. After a few Months the Camp was shut down again and the Building was demolished in the 1950S. A Plaque commemorating the Camp was installed in 1988 but taken down in 1990 ; as of 2023 there is no memorial Board for the Camp."
