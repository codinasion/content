title: "Diminishing returns"
short_summary: "Economic theory"
description: "In Economics diminishing Returns are the Decrease of marginal Output of a Production Process as the Amount of a single Factor of Production is incrementally increased with all other Factors of Production equal. The Law of diminishing Returns States that in productive Processes increasing a Factor of Production by one Unit while maintaining all other Production Factors constant will at some Point produce a lower Unit of Output per incremental Unit of Input. The Law of diminishing Returns does not cause a Decrease in overall Production Capabilities it defines a Point on a Production Curve whereby the Production of an additional Unit of Output will result in a Loss and is known as negative Returns. Under diminishing Returns Output remains positive but Productivity and Efficiency Decrease."
