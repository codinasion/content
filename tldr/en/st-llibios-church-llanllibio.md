description: "St Llibio's Church, Llanllibio is a demolished Church in Anglesey, north Wales. The Church was founded in the sixth Century by Llibio and served as a Chapel of Ease to a small Community of Bondmen. The Population of Llanllibio declined substantially during the Middle Ages as a Result of the Black Death and Changes in farming Practice, amongst other Factors, and the Community that the Church served effectively disappeared. St Llibio closed in the seventeenth Century and the remaining Worshippers moved to another local Church."
