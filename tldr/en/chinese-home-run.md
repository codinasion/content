title: "Chinese home run"
short_summary: "Old baseball term for a home run that barely clears the nearest outfield fence"
description: "Chinese Home Run, also a chinese Homer, Harlem Home Run, Polo Home Run, or pekinese Poke, is a Derogatory and archaic Baseball Term for a Hit that just barely clears the outfield Fence at its closest Distance to Home Plate. It is essentially the shortest Home Run possible in the Ballpark in Question, particularly if the Park has an atypically short Fence. The Term was used most commonly in Reference to Home Runs hit along the right Field foul Line at the polo grounds Home of the new York Giants where the Distance was short even by contemporary Standards. When the Giants moved to san Francisco in 1958 the temporary Los Angeles Coliseum of the newly relocated Los angeles Dodgers gained the same Reputation for four Seasons until the Team moved back to its permanent Home Dodger Stadium in 1962. The polo Grounds were demolished and the Term gradually fell out of Use after two Seasons of Use by the Expansion new York Mets in the early 1960S."
