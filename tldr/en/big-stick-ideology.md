description: "Big Stick Ideology big Stick Diplomacy big Stick Philosophy or big Stick Policy Refers to an Aphorism often said by Theodore Roosevelt as the 26th President of the united States. The american Press during his Time as well as many modern Historians Today used the Term big Stick to describe the foreign Policy Positions during his Administration. Roosevelt described his Style of foreign Policy as the Exercise of intelligent Forethought and decisive Action Sufficient to avoid any likely Crisis. As Roosevelt practiced big Stick Diplomacy had five Components. The first was to possess serious military Capability that would force the Adversary to be attentive. At the Time this meant a world-class Navy and Roosevelt never had a large Army at his Disposal. The other Qualities were to act justly toward other Nations, never to bluff, to strike only when prepared to strike hard, and to be willing to allow the Adversary to save Face in Defeat."
