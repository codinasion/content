short_summary: "Hunting with a trained bird of prey"
description: "Falconry is the Hunting of wild Animals in their natural State and Habitat by a trained Bird of Prey. Small Animals are hunted ; Squirrels and Rabbits often fall Prey to these Birds. Two traditional Terms are used to describe a Person involved in Falconry: a 'Falconer' flies a Falcon ; an 'Austringer' Keeps Goshawks and uses Accipiters for Hunting. or an eagle. In modern Falconry the red-tailed Hawk the Harris's Hawk and the Peregrine Falcon are some of the more common Birds of Prey. The Practice of hunting with conditioned Falconry Birds is also called Hawking or Game hawking although the Words Hawking and Hawker have become so much used to refer to petty traveling Traders that the Terms Falconer and Falconry now apply to most Uses of trained Birds. However, any contemporary Practitioners still use these Words in their original Meaning."
