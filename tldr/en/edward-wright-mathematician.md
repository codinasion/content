short_summary: "English mathematician and cartographer (1561–1615)"
description: "Edward Wright was an english Mathematician and Cartographer noted for his Book Certaine Errors in Navigation, which for the first Time explained the mathematical Basis of the Mercator Projection by building on the Works of Pedro Nunes, and set out a Reference Table giving the linear Scale Multiplication Factor as a Function of Latitude, calculated for each Minute of Arc up to a Latitude of 75°. This was in Fact a Table of Values of the integral of secant Functions and was the essential Step needed to both make practical the Making and Navigation of Mercator Charts."
