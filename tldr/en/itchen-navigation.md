short_summary: "Disused canal system in Hampshire, England"
description: "The Itchen Navigation is a 10. 4-mile disused canal System in Hampshire, England, that provided an important Trading Route from Winchester to the Sea at Southampton for about 150 Years. Improvements to the River Itchen were authorised in 1665 by an Act of Parliament but Progress was slow and Navigation was not declared complete until 1710. It was known as a Navigation because it was essentially an improved River with the main River Channel used for some Sections and Cuts with Locks used to bypass the difficult Sections. Its Waters are fed by the Itchen River. It provided an important Method of transporting Goods particularly agricultural Produce and Coal between the two Cities and the Intervening Villages."
