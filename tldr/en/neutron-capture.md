title: "Neutron capture"
short_summary: "Atomic nuclear process"
description: "Neutron Capture is a nuclear Reaction where an atomic Nucleus and one or more Neutrons Collide and Merge to form a heavier Nucleus. Since Neutrons have no electric Charge they can enter a Nucleus more easily than positively charged Protons who are repelled electrostatically."
