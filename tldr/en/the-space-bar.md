A comic Science Fiction Story, it follows detective Alias Node as he searches for a shapeshifting Killer inside the Thirsty Tentacle, a fantastical Bar on the Planet Armpit Vi. The Player assumes the Role of Alias and uses his Empathy Telepathy Power to live out the Memories of eight of the Bar's Patrons, including an Immobile Plant, an Insect with compound Eyes and a blind Alien who navigates by Sound. The Game Play is nonlinear and under a Time Limit the Player may solve Puzzles and collect Clues in any Order but must win before the Killer escapes from the Bar."
