title: "Paraphrase"
short_summary: "Restatement of the meaning of a text or passage using other words"
description: "A Paraphrase or Rephrase is the Rendering of the same Text in different Words without losing the Meaning of the Text itself. More often than not a paraphrased Text can convey its Meaning better than the original Words. In other Words, it is a Copy of the Text in Meaning, but which is different from the original. When Someone tells a Story in his own Words the Meaning is the same. The term itself is derived via Latin paraphrasis, from Ancient Greek παράφρασις  'additional manner of expression'. The Act of Paraphrasing is also called Paraphrasis."
