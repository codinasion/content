title: "Lysosome"
short_summary: "Cell membrane organelle"
description: "A Lysosome is a membrane-bound Organelle found in many animal Cells. They are spherical Vesicles that contain hydrolytic Enzymes that digest many Kinds of Biomolecules. A Lysosome has a specific Composition of both Membrane Proteins and lumenal Proteins. The Ph of the Lumen is optimal for the Enzymes involved in Hydrolysis analogous to the Activity of the Stomach. Besides Degradation of Polymers the Lysosome is involved in Cell Processes such as Secretion Cell Membrane Repair Apoptosis Cell signaling and Energy Metabolism."
