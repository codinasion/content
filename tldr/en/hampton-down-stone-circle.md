short_summary: "Bronze Age construction in Dorset, England"
description: "Hampton down Stone Circle is a stone Circle near the Village of Portesham in the south-western english County of Dorset. Archaeologists believe that it was erected probably in the Bronze Age. The Hampton down Ring is Part of a Tradition of Stone Circle Construction which extended across much of Britain Ireland and Brittany during the late neolithic and early Bronze Age during a Period between 3300 and 900 a. The Purpose of such Monuments is unknown although Archaeologists speculate that they were likely religious Sites with the Stones having possibly supernatural Associations for those who built the Circles. However it has been suggested that the Site is not a Stone Circle at all but is instead made up of Kerbstones from a Round Barrow from the Bronze Age."
