description: "Pholiota Nubigena, commonly known as the Gastroid Pholiota or the bubble Gum Fungus, is a Species of secotioid Fungus in the Family Strophariaceae. It is found in mountainous Areas of the western united States where it grows on rotting Conifer Wood often fir Logs. It fruits in Spring often under Snow and in the early Summer toward the End of the snowmelt Period in high Mountain Forests. Fruit Bodies appear similar to unopened Mushrooms, measuring 1–4 Centimetres tall with 1–2. 4 cm diameter caps that are whitish to brownish. They have a short but distinct whitish Stipe that extends into the Cap through the internal Spore Mass of the Fruit Body. The gleba consists of irregular chambers made of contorted gills that are brownish in color. In young Specimens a whitish Cottony partial Veil is present but it often disappears with Age and does not leave a Ring on the Stipe."
