title: "Dunstanburgh Castle"
short_summary: "Ruined medieval castle in Northumberland, England"
description: "Dunstanburgh Castle is a Fortification built in the 14th Century on the Coast of Northumberland in northern England between the Villages of Craster and Embleton. The Castle was built between 1313 and 1322 by earl Thomas of Lancaster taking Advantage of the Site's natural Defences and the existing Earthworks of an Iron Age Fort. Thomas was the Leader of a baronial Faction opposed to king edward Ii and probably intended Dunstanburgh to act as a Secure Refuge should the political Situation in southern England Deteriorate. The Castle served also as a Statement of the Earl's Wealth and Influence and would have provoked Comparisons to the nearby royal Castle of Bamburgh. Thomas probably only visited his new Castle once before being captured at the Battle of Boroughbridge when he attempted to flee royal Forces for the Safety of Dunstanburgh. Thomas was executed and the Castle became the Property of the Crown before passing on to the Duchy of Lancaster."
