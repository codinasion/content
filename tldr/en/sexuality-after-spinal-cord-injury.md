title: "Sexuality after spinal cord injury"
short_summary: "Aspect of human sexuality"
description: "Although spinal Cord Injury often causes sexual Dysfunction many People with Sci are able to have satisfying Sex Lives. Physical Restrictions acquired from Sci affect the sexual Function and Sexuality of People in broader Areas and this in Turn has important Impacts on the Quality of Life. Damage to the spinal Cord impairs its Ability to communicate Messages between the Brain and Parts of the Body below the Level of the Lesion. This Results in Lost or reduced Sensation and Muscle Motion, and affects Orgasm, Erection, Ejaculation, and vaginal Lubrication. Indirect Causes of sexual Dysfunction include Pain Weakness and side Effects of Medications. Psycho-social Causes include Depression and altered Self-Image. Many People with Sci have satisfied Sex Lives and many Experience sexual Arousal and Orgasm. People with Sci may employ a Variety of Adaptations to help carry on their Sex Lives healthily by focusing on different Areas of the Body and Types of sexual Acts. Neural Plasticity may account for Increases in Sensitivity in Parts of the Body that have not lost Sensation, so People often find newly sensitive erotic Areas of the Skin in erogenous Zones or near Borders between Areas of preserved and lost Sensation."
