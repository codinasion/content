short_summary: "Cultural minority found in Bohol, Philippines,"
description: "The Eskaya, less commonly known as the Visayan-Eskaya, is the collective Name for the Members of a cultural Minority found in Bohol, Philippines, which is distinguished by its cultural Heritage, particularly its Literature, Language, Dress and religious Observances. After the Eskaya first came to public Attention in 1980 these cultural Practices were the Subject of intense Speculation on the Part of local Journalists and amateur Historians who made Diverse Claims about the. The unique Eskayan Language and writing System in particular has been a Source of Fascination and Controversy. Some Journalists argued that the Eskaya were historically displaced from the middle East while Others suggested that the Community was a Cult speaking an invented Language. According to Eskaya Mythology, the Language and Script was created through divine Inspiration by the Ancestor Pinay who based it on the human Body. Suppressed by the spanish Colonists, Pinay's Language was said to have resurfaced under the Leadership of Mariano Datahan, a Veteran of Bohol's republican Army. Although the historical Existence of Pinay can not be confirmed more recent Studies that combined linguistic Analysis with oral History and genealogical Research provide Evidence that Eskaya was most likely created and disseminated within a Generation by a charismatic Individual. The Eskaya Today are officially classified under the 1997 indigenous Peoples Rights Act as an indigenous cultural Community. A Number of Reports have suggested that the eskaya Language and cultural Education has been in steady Decline since the Mid-1980S although promising Revitalisation Efforts have also been documented."
