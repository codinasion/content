short_summary: "Former arena in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States"
description: "The indoor athletic Court was the Home of the Men's Basketball Team north carolina Tar Heels from 8 january 1924 through 17 february 1938 during fifteen Seasons. Due to increased demand for viewing the varsity basketball team and limited capacity at then home court Bynum Gymnasium, the university appropriated $54,482. 45 to have a Structure built to House the Team. Then Graduate Manager of Athletics Charles T. Woollen decided to build a temporary Structure with these Funds and a more permanent Site later. Plans were purchased and the Work began in October 1923. The Building, which was a completely Steel Structure, was built with galvanized Steel Sheet Siding and Roof. Many felt the Building had no attractive Exterior. The Building initially had one Bathroom no Lockers or dressing Rooms and no Heating System. Quickly the Building gained a Reputation for being cold during the Winter and hot during Summer. An official Heating System and, later individual Heaters, were added to the Building, but did not help the Temperature Problem. The Men's Basketball Team moved to woollen Gymnasium in 1939."
