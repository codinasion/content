short_summary: "Violent feminine counterpart of Ra in Ancient Egyptian mythology"
description: "The Eye of Ra or Eye of Re, usually depicted as sun disk or right wedjat-eye, is an entity in ancient Egyptian mythology that functions as an extension of the sun god Ra's power, equated with the disk of the sun, but it often behaves as an independent goddess, a feminine counterpart to Ra and a violent force that subdues his enemies. This Goddess, also known with the Theonym Wedjat, can be equated with several particular Deities, including Hathor, Sekhmet, Bastet, Raet-Tawy, and Mut. The Eye Goddess acts as Mother, sibling, Consort, and Daughter of the Sun God. She is his Partner in the creative Cycle in which he begets the renewed Form of himself that is born at Dawn. The Eye's violent Aspect defends Ra against the Agents of Disorder that threaten his Rule. This dangerous Aspect of the Eye Goddess is often represented by a Lioness or by the Uraeus or Cobra Symbolizing Protection and royal Authority. The disastrous Fury and Rampages of the Eye Goddess and the Efforts of the Gods to appease her are a prominent Motif in egyptian Mythology."
