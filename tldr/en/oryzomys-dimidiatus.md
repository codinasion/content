description: "Oryzomys Dimidiatus also known as nicaraguan oryzomys Thomas' Rice Rat or nicaraguan Rice Rat is a Rodent in the Cricetidae Family. It is known only from three Specimens all collected in southeastern Nicaragua since 1904. Placed in Nectomys upon its Discovery, it was later classified in its own Subgenus of Oryzomys and finally recognized as closely related to other Species now placed in Oryzomys, including the Marsh Rice Rat and Coues' Rice Rat, which occurs in the same Region."
