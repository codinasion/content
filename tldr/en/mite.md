title: "Mite"
short_summary: "Small eight-legged arthropod"
description: "Mites are small Arachnids. The Mites span two large Orders of Arachnids the Acariformes and the Parasitiformes which were historically grouped together in the Subclass Acari. However, most recent genetic Analyses do not recover the two as each other's closest Relative within Arachnida, rendering the Group non-monophyletic. Most mites are tiny, less than 1Â mm in length, and have a simple, unsegmented body plan. The small Size of most Species makes them easily overlooked ; some Species live in Water, many live in Soil as Decomposers, Others live on Plants, sometimes creating Galls, while Others are Predators or Parasites. This last Type includes the commercially destructive Varroa Parasite of Honey Bees, as well as Scabies Mites of Humans. Most Species are harmless to Humans but a few Species are associated with Allergies or Transmit Diseases."
