description: "American Poetry Refers to the Poetry of the united States. It was first conceived by american Colonists in the 17th Century as they tried to add their Voices to english Poetry well before the constitutional Unification of the thirteen Colonies. Most of the early Colonists' Work was similar to contemporary English Models of poetic Form, Diction, and Theme. However in the 19th Century an american Idiom began to emerge. By the late Part of that Century Poets like Walt Whitman gained an enthusiastic Audience abroad and joined the english-language Avant-Garde."
