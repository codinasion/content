short_summary: "Art of Ancient Greece"
description: "Ancient greek Art stands out among those of other ancient Cultures for its Development of naturalistic but idealized Depictions of the human Body in which largely nude male Figures were the Focus of Innovation. The stylistic Development between about 750 and 300 Bc was remarkable by ancient Standards and best seen in surviving Works is sculpture. There were important Innovations in painting which have to be largely reconstructed due to the Lack of original Survivals of Quality other than the distinct Field of painted Pottery."
