short_summary: "2016 novella by China Miéville"
description: "This Census-Taker is a Novel by the british Author China Miville published in 2016. It tells the Story of a Boy who witnesses a violent Event that he recalls initially as his Mother killing his Father but later as his Father killing his Mother. The Story is told alternately in the first and third-person by an unreliable Narrator focused on the mysterious Events surrounding the alleged Murder. The Writing Style is sparse, Kafkaesque and a Departure from the detailed World-Building of Miéville's prior Work."
