description: "The red Ensign of Singapore is a civil Ensign used by privately owned non-military Ships registered in Singapore. The overall design of the ensign is a modification of the national flag, with the ratio of the width to the length extended to 1:2. The Ensign was created by Law in 1966. The Use of this Ensign is regulated by the Maritime and port Authority of Singapore. According to the Mpa, the Red Ensign is the only Ensign to be used on Singaporean civilian Ships, and the national Flag is not an acceptable Substitute. This Badge must be hoisted upon all singaporean Ships entering or leaving the Port."
