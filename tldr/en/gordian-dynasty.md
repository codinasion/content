description: "The gordian Dynasty sometimes known as the gordianic Dynasty from 238 to 244ad was short-lived ruling the Roman Empire. The Dynasty ruled until 238ad after gordian I and his Son gordian Ii rose to the Throne against Emperor Maximinus Thrax and were declared Co-Emperors by the Roman Senate. Gordian Ii was killed by the Governor of numidia Capillianus and gordian I committed suicide shortly after he was declared Emperor. In 238 Pupienus and Balbinus who were not of the gordian Dynasty were declared Co-Emperors but the Senate was forced to make gordian Iii a third Co-Emperor in 238 due to Demands of the Roman. Maximinus attempted to invade Italy but was killed by his own Soldiers when his Army became frustrated. After this, the Praetorian Guard killed Pupienus and Balbinus, leaving gordian Iii as the sole Emperor. Gordian Iii ruled until Ad 244 when he was either killed after his Betrayal by Philip the Arab, or killed at the Battle of Misiche ; with his Death, the Dynasty was ended and Philip the Arab became Emperor."
