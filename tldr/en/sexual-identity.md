Sexual Identity and sexual Behavior are closely related to sexual Orientation, but they are distinguished, with Identity referring to an Individual's Conception of themselves, behavior referring to actual sexual Acts performed by the Individual, and sexual Orientation referring to romantic or sexual Attractions toward Persons of the opposite Sex or Gender, the same Sex or Gender, to both Sexes or more than one Gender, or to no One."
