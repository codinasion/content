The Protest began in 1976 with the Blanket Protest when the british Government withdrew the special Category Status for convicted paramilitary Prisoners. The Dispute escalated into the dirty Protest in 1978 where Prisoners refused to leave their Cells to wash and covered their Cells with Excrement. In 1980 seven Prisoners participated in the first Hunger Strike which ended after 53 Days."
