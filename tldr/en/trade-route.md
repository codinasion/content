description: "A Trade Route is a logistical Network defined as a Series of Pathways and Stops used for commercial Transport of Cargo. The Term can also be used to refer to trade over Water Bodies. Allowing Goods to reach distant Markets, a single Trade Route contains long-distance Arteries, which may further be connected to smaller Networks of commercial and noncommercial Transportation Routes. Among notable Trade Routes was the Amber Road which served as a reliable Network for long Distance Trade. Maritime Trade along the spice Route became prominent during the middle Ages when Nations resorted to military Means to control this influential Route. During the middle Ages Organisations such as the hanseatic League aimed at protecting the Interests of the Merchants and Trade became increasingly prominent."
