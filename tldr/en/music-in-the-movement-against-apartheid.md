description: "The Apartheid Regime began in south Africa in 1948 and lasted until 1994. It involved a System of institutionalized racial Segregation and white Supremacy and placed all political Power in the Hands of a white Minority. Opposition to apartheid manifested in a Variety of Ways, including Boycotts, non-violent Protests, and armed Resistance. Music played a large Role in the Movement against Apartheid within south Africa as well as in the international Opposition to apartheid. The Impacts of Songs opposing Apartheid included raising Awareness, generating Support for the Movement against Apartheid, building Unity within this Movement, and 'presenting an alternative Vision of Culture in a Future democratic South Africa."
