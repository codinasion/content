short_summary: "Species of bird"
description: "The Water Rail is a Bird of the Rail Family and Breeds in well-vegetated Wetlands across Europe Asia and North Africa. Northern and eastern Populations are migratory but this species is a permanent Resident in the warmer Areas of its Breeding Range. The Adult is 2328cm long and like other Rails has a Body that is laterally flattened allowing easier Passage through the Reed beds it inhabits. It has mainly brown Upperparts and blue-grey Underparts, black Barring on the Flanks, long Toes, a short Tail and a long reddish Bill. Immature Birds are generally similar in Appearance to adult Birds but the Blue-Grey in their Plumage is replaced by Buff. The downy chicks are black, as with all rails. The former Subspecies R. Indicus, has distinctive Markings and a Call that is very different from the pig-like Squeal of the western Races, and is now usually split as a separate Species, the brown-cheeked Rail."
