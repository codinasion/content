title: "Aramburu Island"
short_summary: "Island in California"
description: "Aramburu Island is a 17-acre Island in Richardson Bay Marin County California. It was created in the 1950s and 1960s as a Result of dumping dredged Material from nearby Developments into the Bay along with Strawberry Spit. In the 1980s the northern Portion of the Landmass was cut off from Strawberry Spit on the Orders of a marin County Supervisor to prevent Housing from being constructed there creating Aramburu Island. While natural Erosion processes caused it to shrink slowly over the Course of subsequent Decades a Restoration Effort in the 2010s added large Amounts of Material to prevent further Erosion and turned it into sustainable Bird Habitat."
