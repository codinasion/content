short_summary: "Pacific typhoon in 1981"
description: "Typhoon Agnes, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Pining, produced among the heaviest Rains recorded during the 20th Century in South Korea, with 710 Mm falling over a two-day Span. The Storm originated as a tropical Depression near Guam on 25 August 1981. Moving along a West-Northwest to northwestern track the System gradually strengthened as deep Convection around it was organized. The Depression was assigned the Name Agnes on august 27 following the Development of gale Force Winds. Further Intensification to Typhoon-Status occurred by August 29. Agnes reached its peak Intensity over the east China Sea on august 31 as a Category2-Equivalent on the Saffirsimpson Hurricane wind Scale with Wind Speeds of 175kmh. Subsequent Interaction with a mid-latitude Trough induced an extratropical Transition as the Cyclone slowed and turned north. The System had lost most of its tropical Characteristics by September1 with the Majority of Convection shearing Northeast over south Korea and Japan. Agnes later accelerated Northeast and completed its Transition on September 3. The Remnants continued along this Course impacting northern Japan and the Kamchatka Peninsula before being last reported near the international Date Line on September 6th."
