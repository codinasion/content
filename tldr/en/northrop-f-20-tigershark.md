short_summary: "Prototype fighter aircraft developed from F-5"
description: "The northrop f-20 Tigershark is a light Fighter Fighter designed and built by Northrop. Its Development began in 1975 as a further Evolution of Northrop's f-5e Tiger Ii featuring a new Engine that greatly improved overall Performance and a modern Avionics suite including a powerful and flexible Radar. Compared with the F-5E, the F-20 was much faster, gained beyond-visual-range air-to-air Capability, and had a full Suite of air-to-ground Modes capable of utilizing most U. S. Weapons. With these improved Capabilities the f-20 became competitive with contemporary Fighter Designs such as general Dynamics's f-16 Fighting Falcon but was much less expensive to purchase and operate."
