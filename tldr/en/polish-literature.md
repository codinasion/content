short_summary: "Literary tradition of Poland"
description: "Polish Literature is the Literature of Poland. Most polish Literature has been written in the polish Language, though other Languages used in Poland over the Centuries have also contributed to polish literary Traditions, including Latin, Yiddish, Lithuanian, Russian, German and Esperanto. For Centuries polish Literature focused more on Drama and poetic Self-Expression according to Czesaw Miosz than on Fiction. The Reasons were manifold but mostly rested on the historical Circumstances of the Nation. Polish Writers typically have had a more profound Range of Choices to motivate them to write, including past Cataclysms of extraordinary Violence that swept Poland, but also, Poland's collective Incongruities demanding an adequate Reaction from the writing Communities of any given Period."
