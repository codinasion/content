description: "Bank Markazi V. Peterson, 578 U. S. 212 was a united States supreme Court Case which found that a Law which only applied to a specific Case identified by Docket Number and eliminated all defenses a Party had raised does not violate the Separation of Powers in the united. The Plaintiffs in the Case had obtained Judgments against Iran for its Role in supporting state-sponsored Terrorism particularly the 1983 Beirut Barracks Bombings and the 1996 Khobar Tower Bombing and sought Execution on a new York Bank account held on Behalf of Bank markazi central Bank of. The Plaintiffs obtained Court Orders preventing the Transfer of Funds from the Account in 2008 and filed Suit in 2010. Bank Markazi brought several Defenses including that the Account was not an Asset of the Bank but rather an Asset of its european Intermediary under both new York State Property Law and the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act. In response to concerns that existing laws were insufficient for the account to be used to settle the judgments, Congress added an amendment to a 2012 bill, codified after enactment as 22 U. S. C. ยง 8772, that identified the pending Lawsuit by Docket Number, applied only to the Assets in the identified Case, and effectively abrogated every legal Basis available to Bank Markazi to prevent the Plaintiffs from executing their Claims against the Account. Bank Markazi then argued that 8772 was an unconstitutional Breach of Separation of Power between legislative and judicial Branches of Government because it effectively directed a specific Result in a single Case without altering the generally applicable Law. The united States District Court for the southern District of new York and the united States Court of Appeals for the second Circuit both upheld the Constitutionality of 8772 and cleared the Way for the Plaintiffs to execute their Judgments. 75 billion in Cash."
