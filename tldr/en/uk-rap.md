description: "Uk Rap, also known as british Hip Hop or Uk Hip Hop, is a Genre of Music, and a Culture that covers a Variety of Styles of Hip Hop Music made in the United Kingdom. It is generally classified as one of a Number of rbhip-hop Styles. British hip hop can also be referred to as Brit-hop, a term coined and popularised mainly by British Vogue magazine and the BBC. British Hip Hop was originally influenced by the Dub/Toasting introduced to the United Kingdom by Jamaican Migrants in the 1950s–70s, who eventually developed uniquely influenced Rapping in Order to match the Rhythm of the ever-increasing Pace and Aggression of Jamaican-Influenced Dub in the Uk.
