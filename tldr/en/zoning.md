title: "Zoning"
short_summary: "Government policy allowing certain uses of land in different places"
description: "In urban Planning Zoning is a Method by which a Municipality or other Tier of Government Divides land into Zones each of which has a Set of Regulations for new Development that Differs from other Zones. Zones may be defined for a single Use, they may combine several compatible Activities by Use, or in the Case of form-based Zoning, the differing Regulations may govern the Density, Size and Shape of allowed Buildings whatever their Use. The Planning Rules for each zone Determine whether a particular Development can be granted planning Permission. Zoning may specify a Variety of Outright and conditional Uses of the Land. It can indicate the Size and Dimensions of the Lots in which Land may be subdivided or the Shape and Scale of Buildings. These Guidelines are set out to guide urban Growth and Development."
