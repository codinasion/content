short_summary: "Nonfiction book by law professor Christopher M. Fairman"
description: "Fuck: Word Taboo and Protecting our First Amendment Liberties is a Nonfiction Book by Law Professor Christopher M. Fairman about Freedom of Speech, the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, Censorship, and Use of the Word Fuck in Society. The Book was first published by Sphinx in 2009 as a Follow-Up to the Author's Article Fuck published in 2007 in the Cardozo Law Review. It cites Studies from Academics in social Science, Psychoanalysis, and Linguistics. Fairman establishes that most current Usages of the Word have Connotations distinct from its Meaning of sexual Intercourse. The Book discusses the Attempts of Conservatives in the united States to censor the Word from common Parlance. The Author says that its Use is unclear because of contradictory Court Decisions. Fairman argues that once Citizens allow the Government to limit the Use of specific Words this will infringe upon the Freedom of Thought."
