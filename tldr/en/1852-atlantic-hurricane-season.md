short_summary: "Hurricane season in the Atlantic Ocean"
description: "The 1852 Atlantic hurricane season was one of only three Atlantic hurricane seasons in which every known tropical cyclone attained hurricane status. Five tropical cyclones were reported during the season, which lasted from late August through the middle of October; these dates fall within the range of most Atlantic tropical cyclone activity, and none of the cyclones coexisted with another. Even though there were officially five tropical Cyclones during the Season Hurricane Scholar Michael chenoweth regarded two of the Cyclones as being the same Storm. There may have been other unconfirmed tropical Cyclones during the Season, as Meteorologist Christopher Landsea estimated that up to six Storms were missed each Year from the official Database ; this Estimate was due to small tropical Cyclone Size, sparse Ship Reports, and relatively unpopulated Coastlines."
