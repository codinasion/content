short_summary: "Rivalry between two London football teams"
description: "The Rivalry between Millwall and west Ham united is one of the longest-standing and most bitter Rivalries in english Football. The two Teams then known as Thames Ironworks and Millwall athletic both originated in the east End of London and were located less than three Miles apart. They played each other for the first Time in the 18991900 fa Cup. The Match was historically known as the Dockers derby as both Sets of Supporters were predominantly Dockers on the Thames Shipyards. Consequently each Set of Fans worked for rival Firms competing for the same Business so that Tensions between the Teams intensified. In 1904 west Ham moved to the Boleyn Ground which then was Part of Essex until a london boundary Change in 1965. In 1910 Millwall moved through the Thames river to new Cross in south east London and the Teams were no longer east London Neighbours. Since then both Sides have relocated but they remain just under four Miles apart. Millwall moved to the Den in Bermondsey in 1993 and West Ham to the London Stadium in Stratford in 2016."
