short_summary: "Logistical support of the International Force East Timor"
description: "The logistical Support of the multinational International Force East Timor peacekeeping Mission in 1999 and 2000 involved, at its Peak, 11,693 Personnel from 23 Countries. Of these 5,697 were from Australia, making it the largest Deployment of australian Forces overseas since the Vietnam War. Interfet was unusual in that it was led by Australia, casting the Country in a wholly unfamiliar Role. In the 1990s the Logistics and Support Areas of the australian Defence Force had suffered deep Cuts. The Adf had not anticipated being committed to such a large Peacekeeping Mission and was unprepared to support an australian Force of this Size much less act as lead Nation of an international Coalition."
