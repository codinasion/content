short_summary: "1981 song written by Bob Dylan"
description: "Angelina is a Song by the american Singer-Songwriter Bob Dylan recorded on 26 March 1981 for his Album Shot of Love but not included on the Record. The Song was written by Dylan and produced by Jimmy Iovine. A Version was released exactly ten Years later on 26 March 1991 on the Bootleg Series volumes 1-3 1961-1991. A different Take was published on the Bootleg Series Vol. 16: Springtime in New York 1980â€“1985 in 2021. Critics have expressed their Lack of Understanding of the Lyrics, whilst generally affording the Song a positive Reception. Dylan's Rhyming of the Name in the Title of the Song with 'Concertina', 'Hyena', 'Subpoena', 'Argentina' and 'Arena' has attracted Commentary, with scholar Nicholas Birns calling the Rhymes 'Bravura and. . . provocative'."
