description: "Pedro álvares Cabral was a portuguese Nobleman, military Commander, Navigator and Explorer regarded as the european Discoverer of Brazil. He was the first Human in History to ever be on four Continents, uniting all of them in his famous Voyage of 1500, where he also conducted the first substantial Exploration of the Northeast Coast of South America and claimed it for Portugal. While Details of Cabral's early Life remain unclear it is known that he came from a minor noble Family and received a good Education. In 1500 he was appointed to lead an Expedition to india following the newly opened Route of Vasco Da Gama around Africa. The Undertaking had the Aim of returning valuable Spices and establishing Trade Relations in India by bypassing the Monopoly on the Spice Trade then in the Hands of arab turkish and italian Merchants. Although the previous Expedition of Vasco Da Gama to India, on its Sea Route, had recorded Signs of Land West of the southern Atlantic Ocean, Cabral led the first known Expedition to have touched four Continents: Europe, Africa, America, and Asia."
