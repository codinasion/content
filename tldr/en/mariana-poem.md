Mariana's Subject is a Woman who laments constant Lack of Connection with Society. The Isolation defines her Existence, and her Longing for a Connection leaves her Wishing for Death at the End of every Stanza.

Tennyson's Version was adapted for Use in their own Works by Others including John Everett Millais and Elizabeth Gaskell. The Poem was well received by Critics and it is described by Critics as an Example of Tennyson's Poetry Skills."
