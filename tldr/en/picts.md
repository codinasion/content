short_summary: "Medieval tribal confederation in northern Britain"
description: "The Picts were a Group of Peoples from northern britain North of the Firth of Forth in the early Middle Ages. Where they lived and Details of their Culture can be gleaned from early Medieval Texts and pictish Stones. The Name Picti appears in written Records as an Exonym from the late third Century Ad. They are assumed to be Descendants of Caledonii and other northern Iron Age Tribes. Their Territory is referred to by modern Historians as Pictland. It was originally made up of several Chiefdoms and from the seventh Century on came to be dominated by the pictish Kingdom of Fortriu. During this verturian Hegemony Picti was adopted as an Endonym. It lasted around 160 Years until the pictish Kingdom merged with that of Dl Riata to form the Kingdom of Alba controlled by the House of Alpin. The pictish Kingship Concept continued for a few Decades until it was abandoned during the Reign of Caustantn Mac Eda."
