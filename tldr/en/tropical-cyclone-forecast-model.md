short_summary: "Computer program that uses meteorological data to forecast tropical cyclones"
description: "A tropical Cyclone Forecast Model is a Computer Program that uses meteorological Data to forecast Aspects of the future State of tropical Cyclones. There are three Types of Models statistical dynamical or combined statistical-dynamic. Dynamical Models use powerful Supercomputers with sophisticated mathematical Modeling Software and meteorological Data to calculate future Weather Conditions. Statistical Models forecast the Evolution of a tropical Cyclone in a more simple Manner by extrapolating from historical Datasets and thus can be quickly run on Platforms such as personal Computers. Statistical-dynamical Models use Aspects of both Kinds of Forecasting. Four primary Types of Forecasts exist for tropical Cyclones: Track, Intensity, Storm Surge, and Rainfall. Dynamical models were not developed until the 1970s and the 1980s, with earlier efforts focused on the storm surge problem."
