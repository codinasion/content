short_summary: "Room or cell in which prisoners were held, usually during the Middle Ages and Renaissance"
description: "A Dungeon is a Room or Cell in which Prisoners are held specially underground. Dungeons are generally associated with medieval Castles although their Association with Torture probably derives more from the Renaissance Period. An Oubliette or Bottle Dungeon is a Basement which is accessible only from a Hatch or through a Hole in a high Ceiling. Victims in Oubliettes were often left to starve and dehydrate to Death, making the Practice akin To—And some say an actual Variety Of—Immurement."
