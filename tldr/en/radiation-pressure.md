title: "Radiation pressure"
short_summary: "Pressure exerted upon any surface exposed to electromagnetic radiation"
description: "Radiation Pressure is mechanical Pressure exerted on a Surface due to the Exchange of Momentum between the Object and the electromagnetic Field. This includes the Momentum of Light or electromagnetic Radiation of any Wavelength that is absorbed reflected or otherwise emitted by Matter on any Scale. The associated Force is called Radiation Pressure Force or sometimes just Force of Light."
