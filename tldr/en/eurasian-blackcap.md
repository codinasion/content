short_summary: "Bird in the Old World warbler family from Eurasia and Africa"
description: "The eurasian Blackcap often known simply as Blackcap is a common and widespread typical Warbler. It has mainly olive-grey upper Parts and pale Grey Underparts and Differences between the five Subspecies are small. Both Sexes have a Neat coloured Cap to the Head, black in the Male and reddish-brown in the Female. The Male's typical Song is a rich musical warbling often ending in a loud high-pitched Crescendo but in some isolated Areas such as Valleys in the Alps a Simpler Song is given. The closest Relative of Blackcap is the Garden Warbler which looks quite different but has a similar Song."
