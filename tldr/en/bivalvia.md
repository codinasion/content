short_summary: "Class of molluscs"
description: "In the past Centuries bivalvia known as Lamellibranchiata and Pelecypoda is a Class of Marine and Freshwater Molluscs that have laterally compressed Bodies enclosed by a Shell consisting of two hinged Parts. As a Group bivalves lack a Head and they lack usual molluscan Organs like the Radula and Odontophore. The Class includes the Clams, Oysters, Cockles, Mussels, Scallops, and numerous other Families that live in Saltwater, as well as a Number of Families that live in Freshwater. The Majority are filter Feeders. The Gills evolved into Ctenidia which are specialised Organs for Feeding and Breathing. Most bivalves bury themselves in sediment, where they are relatively safe from predation. Others lay on the Sea Floor or attach themselves to rock or other hard Surfaces. Some Bivalves such as Scallops and Fileshells can swim. Shipworms feed on Clay or Wood and live Inside."
