title: "Hungarian occupation of Yugoslav territories"
short_summary: "Part of Yugoslavia occupied then annexed by Hungary"
description: "During World War Ii, the Kingdom of Hungary engaged in the military Occupation, then Annexation, of the Bačka, Baranja, Međimurje and Prekmurje Regions of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. These Territories had all been under hungarian Rule before 1920 and were transferred as Part of the Treaty of Trianon after World War I to yugoslavia. They now form Part of several States: Yugoslav Bačka is now Part of Vojvodina, an autonomous Province of Serbia, Yugoslav Baranja and Međimurje are Part of modern-day Croatia, and Yugoslav Prekmurje is Part of modern-day Slovenia. The Occupation began on April 11 1941 when 80000 hungarian Troops crossed the Yugoslav Border in Support of the german-led axis Invasion of Yugoslavia which had started five Days earlier. There was some Resistance from Serb Chetnik irregulars to hungarian Forces but by this Time the Defences of the Royal Yugoslav Army had collapsed. The hungarian Forces were indirectly aided by the local Volksdeutsche the german Minority which formed a Militia and disarmed around 90000 Yugoslav Troops. Despite just sporadic Resistance hungarian Troops killed many Civilians during these initial Operations including some Volksdeutsche. The Government of newly formed axis Puppet State the independent State of Croatia subsequently consented to the hungarian Annexation of the Area of Meimurje which dismayed the Croat Population."
