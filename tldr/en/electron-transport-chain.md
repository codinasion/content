short_summary: "Energy-producing metabolic pathway"
description: "An Electron Transport Chain is a Series of Protein Complexes and other Molecules that transfer Electrons from Electron Donors via redox Reactions to electron Acceptors and Couples this Electron Transfer with the Transfer of Protons across a Membrane. Many Enzymes in the Electron Transport Chain are embedded in the Membrane."
