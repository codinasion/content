Released in December 1988, the Track was primarily composed by Guitarist and Vocalist Joe Genaro and Bassist Dave Schulthise, though it is credited to all four Band Members. The Idea behind the Song was to create a Punk Rock nursery rhyme as such it is a simple Love Song written from the Perspective of a sheltered Boy Dreaming of a rowdy Delinquent Girlfriend. Lyrically it depicts the Duo Bonding over Record Shopping and eating Pizza."
