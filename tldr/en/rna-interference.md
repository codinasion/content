title: "RNA interference"
short_summary: "Biological process of gene regulation"
description: "RNA interference is a biological process in which RNA molecules are involved in sequence-specific suppression of gene expression by double-stranded RNA, through translational or transcriptional repression. Historically, Rnai was known by other Names, including Co-Suppression, post-transcriptional Gene Silencing, and quelling. The detailed study of each of these seemingly different processes elucidated that the identity of these phenomena were all actually RNAi. Andrew Fire and Craig C. Mello shared the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their Work on Rnai in the nematode Worm Caenorhabditis elegans that they published in 1998. Since the discovery of RNAi and its regulatory potentials, it has become evident that RNAi has immense potential in suppression of desired genes. RNAi is now known as precise, efficient, stable and better than antisense therapy for gene suppression. Antisense Rna produced intracellularly by an Expression Vector may be developed and find usefulness as novel therapeutic Agents."
