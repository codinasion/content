title: "Heavy infantry"
short_summary: "Heavily armed and armoured soldiers"
description: "Heavy Infantry consisted of heavily armed and armoured Infantrymen who were trained to mount frontal Assaults and/or anchor the defensive Center of a Battle Line. This differentiated them from light Infantry who are relatively mobile and lightly armoured skirmisher Troops intended for Screening, Scouting, and other tactical Roles unsuited to Soldiers carrying heavier Loads. Heavy Infantry typically made Use of dense Battlefield Formations, such as Shield Wall or Phalanx, multiplying their effective Weight of Arms with Force Concentration."
