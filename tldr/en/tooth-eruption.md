short_summary: "Process in tooth development"
description: "Tooth Eruption is a Process in tooth Development in which teeth enter the Mouth and become visible. It is believed that the periodontal Ligament plays an important Role in tooth Eruption. The first human Teeth to appear, the deciduous Teeth, erupt into the Mouth from around 6 Months until 2 Years of Age, in a Process known as 'teething'. These Teeth are the only Ones in the Mouth until a Person is about 6 Years old creating the primary Dentition Stage. At that Time the first permanent Tooth Erupts and begins a Time in which there is a Combination of permanent and primary Teeth known as the mixed Dentition Stage that lasts until the last primary Tooth is lost. The remaining permanent Teeth then erupt into the Mouth during the permanent Period of Dentition."
