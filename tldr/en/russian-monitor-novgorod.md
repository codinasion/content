short_summary: "Monitor built for the Imperial Russian Navy in the 1870s"
description: "Novgorod was a Monitor built in the 1870s for the imperial russian Navy. She was one of the most unusual Warships ever constructed and survives in popular naval Myth as one of the worst Warships ever built. However a more balanced Analysis Shows that she was relatively effective in her designed Role as a Coast Defence Ship. The Hull was circular to reduce Draught while allowing the Ship to carry much more Armor and a heavier Armament than other Ships of the same Size. Novgorod played a minor Role in the russo-turkish War of 187778 and was reclassified in 1892 as a Coast-Defence Ironclad. The Ship was decommissioned in 1903 and used until 1911 as a Storeship until it was sold for Scrap."
