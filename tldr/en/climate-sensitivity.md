short_summary: "Change in Earth's temperature caused by changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations"
description: "Climate Sensitivity is a Measure of how much it will warm if the Concentration of atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Increases. In technical Terms climate Sensitivity is the average Change in global mean Surface Temperature in Response to a radiative Force which drives a Difference between the Earth's Incoming and outgoing Energy. Climate Sensitivity is a key Measure in Climate Science and a focus Area for Climate Scientists who want to understand the ultimate Consequences of anthropogenic global Warming."
