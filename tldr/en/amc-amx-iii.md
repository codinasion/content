short_summary: "American sports car made by American Motors Corporation"
description: "The Amc Amx3 is a mid-engine Sports Car of the american Carmaker american Motors corporation it was presented in March 1970 and from 1971 was to be produced in Germany by Karmann. With this Vehicle amc wanted to compete with the similarly designed de Tomaso Pantera that Ford sold in the Usa. The car's body and drivetrain were originated and developed by AMC, and it was styled by Dick Teague. Amc consulted italian Suppliers and partnered with italian Suppliers for Chassis and Suspension Development. The Design was initially falsely attributed to giotto Bizzarrini but only specific Components such as certain Suspension Parts actually came from him. In addition, Italdesign, Autocostruzioni S. D. Were also involved in the Development. In the End the Car never reached full Production when, shortly after the official Presentation, Amc abandoned the Project without giving any Reason after about half a Dozen Cars had been made. Several Attempts to revive the Design including a limited Production License Proposal without Amc's Involvement branded as the Bizzarrini Sciabola were unsuccessful. Later an Amc Amx3 Chassis formed the technical Basis for the Iso Varedo 1972 Concept Car."
