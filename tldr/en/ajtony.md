short_summary: "11th century ruler of Banat"
description: "Achtum or Ajtony Ahtum was an early 11th-century Ruler in the Territory now known as Banat in present Romania and Serbia. His primary Source is the long Life of Saint Gerard, a 14th-century Hagiography. Ajtony was a powerful Ruler who owned many Horses, Cattle and Sheep and was baptised according to the Orthodox Rite in Vidin. He taxed Salt which was transferred to king Stephen I of Hungary on the Mure River. The King sent Csanád, Ajtony's former Commander-In-Chief, against him at the Head of a large Army. Csanád defeated and killed Ajtony, occupying his Realm. In the Territory, at least one County and a Roman Catholic Diocese were established."
