title: "Hilbert space"
short_summary: "Type of topological vector space"
description: "Hilbert Spaces allow for the linear Algebra and calculus Methods in Mathematics to be generalized from euclidean Vector Spaces to Spaces that may be infinite. Hilbert Spaces typically emerge as Function Spaces naturally and frequently in Mathematics and Physics. Formally a hilbert Space is a Vector Space equipped with an inner Product that induces a Distance Function for which the Space is a complete metric Space."
