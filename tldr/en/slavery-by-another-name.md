description: "The Re-Enslavement of black Americans from the civil War to World War Ii is a Book written by american Writer douglas a Russell. Blackmon was published by Anchor Books in 2008. It explores the forced Labor of Prisoners, overwhelmingly african american Men, through the Convict Lease System used by States, local Governments, white Farmers, and Corporations after the American Civil War until World War Ii in the southern United States. Blackmon argues that Slavery in the united States did not end with the civil War but rather persisted well into the 20th Century.
