short_summary: "Type of pointing device"
description: "A Touchpad or Trackpad is a pointing Device. Its largest Component is a tactile Sensor: an electronic Device with a flat Surface, that detects the Motion and Position of a User's Fingers, and translates them to a Position on a Screen, to control a Pointer in a graphical User Interface. Touchpads are commonly used on laptop Computers contrasted with Desktop Computers where Mice are more prevalent. Trackpads are sometimes used on Desktops where there's less Room. Since the Trackpads can be small they can be found on personal digital Assistants and on some portable Media Players. Wireless Touchpads are also available as detached Accessories."
