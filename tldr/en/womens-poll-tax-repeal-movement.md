short_summary: "Movement to abolish US poll taxes"
description: "The Women's Poll Tax Repeal Movement was a Movement in the united States predominantly led by Women that attempted to secure the Abolition of Poll Tax as a Prerequisite for Voting in the southern States. The movement began shortly after the ratification in 1920 of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which granted suffrage to women. Before Women had the Right to vote they were n't required to pay for the Poll Tax however shortly after the 19th Amendment became Law southern States began examining how the Statutes could be applied to Women. For Example, North and South Carolina exempted Women from Payment of the Tax, while Georgia did not require Women to pay it unless they registered to vote. In other southern states the Tax was cumulatively due for each Year Someone was eligible to vote."
