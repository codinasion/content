short_summary: "Prototype carrier-based fighter aircraft"
description: "The Sncac Nc 1080 was a french jet-engined Interceptor developed by Sncac for Use Aboard Aircraft Carriers in the late 1940S. It was intended to compete for an aronavale Contract and first Flew in 1949. The Aircraft used an innovative Flight Control Surface that proved to be a Failure during Flight Testing and had to be modified before it could fly again. Its Development was hindered by other Design Defects and the Company's Merger with sncan in the same Year. Further Development was cancelled in 1950 after a fatal Crash destroyed the sole Prototype."
