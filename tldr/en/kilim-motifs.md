short_summary: "Symbolic elements of flat-woven rugs"
description: "Many Motifs are used in traditional Kilims handmade flat-woven Rugs each with many Variations. In turkish Anatolia particularly village Women weave Themes important for their Lives into their Rugs whether before Marriage or during married Life. Some motifs Represent Desires, such as for Happiness and Children ; Others, for Protection against Threats such as Wolves and Scorpions, or against the evil Eye. These Motifs were often matched when woven on Kilims into Patterns. The Meanings of Kilim Patterns have also faded with the Fading of Tribal and Village Cultures in the 20th Century."
