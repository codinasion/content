description: "Hitman 2 is a 2018 Stealth Video Game by io interactive. It is the seventh main Installment in the Hitman Video Game Series, the Sequel to 2016's Hitman and the second Game in the World of Assassination Trilogy. The Game continues the Story Arc started in Hitman, following genetically engineered Assassin Agent 47 as he searches for the mysterious 'Shadow Client' who is trying to destroy Providence, a secretive Organization that controls global Affairs. It also explores more of 47's mysterious Background, which Providence offered to bring to light in Exchange for 47's Assistance. Like its Predecessor the Game is structured around six large Sandbox Locations that Players can freely explore to find Opportunities to eliminate their Targets. It also included two Online Multiplayer Modes called Sniper Assassin and Ghost Mode, though the Game's Servers for both Modes have since been shut down ; Sniper Assassin can still be played Single-Player."
