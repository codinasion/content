description: "The purple-crowned Fairywren is a Species of Bird in the maluridae Family of the australasian Wren. It is the largest of eleven Species in the Genus Malurus and is endemic in northern Australia. The Species Name is derived from the latin Word Crna meaning crown owing to the distinctive purple Circle of crown Feathers sported by breeding Males. Genetic Evidence Shows that the purple-headed Fairywren is most closely related to the splendid Fairywren and the Superb Fairywren. Purple crowned Fairywrens in northern Australia can be distinguished by the Presence of cheek Patches and the deep blue Colour of their Perky Tails from other Fairywrens."
