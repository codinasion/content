title: "Abstract algebra"
short_summary: "Branch of mathematics"
description: "Abstract Algebra or modern Algebra is a Study of algebraic Structures in Mathematics. Algebraic Structures include Groups, Rings, Fields, Modules, Vector Spaces, Lattices, and algebras over a Field. The Term abstract Algebra was coined in the early 20th Century to distinguish it from older Parts of Algebra and more specifically from elementary Algebra using Variables to represent Numbers in Computation and Reasoning. The abstract Perspective on Algebra has become so fundamental to advanced Mathematics that it is simply called Algebra while the abstract Algebra is seldom used except in Pedagogy."
