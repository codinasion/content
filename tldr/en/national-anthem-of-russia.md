description: "The 'State Anthem of the Russian Federation' is the national anthem of Russia. It uses the same Melody as the soviet State Anthem composed by Alexander Alexandrov and new Lyrics by sergey Mikhalkov who collaborated with gabriel el-registan on the original Anthem. From 1944 this earliest Version replaced the Internationale as a new more russian-centric soviet Anthem. The same Melody was used but without Lyrics after 1956. A second Version of the Lyrics was written by Mikhalkov in 1970 and adopted in 1977 with less Emphasis on World War Ii and more on the Victory of Communism and without mentioning by Name Joseph Stalin."
