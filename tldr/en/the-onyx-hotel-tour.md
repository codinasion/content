A Tour to promote the Album was announced in December 2003. Its original Name was the in the Zone Tour, but Spears was sued for Trademark Infringement and banned from using the Name. Spears felt inspired to create a Show with a Hotel Theme which she later mixed with the Concept of an onyx Stone. The Stage inspired by Broadway Musicals was less elaborate than previous Tours. The Setlist was composed mostly by Songs from in the Zone as well as some of her past Songs reworked with different Elements of Jazz, Blues, and Latin Percussion. Tour Promoter Clear Channel Entertainment marketed the Tour to a more Adult Audience than her previous Shows, while Sponsor Mtv promoted the tour heavily on Tv Shows and the Network's Website."
