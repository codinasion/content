short_summary: "Screw corvette class of the Prussian and German Imperial Navy"
description: "The augusta Class of Screw Corvettes were a Pair of Vessels acquired in the 1860S by the prussian Navy. The Class was divided into two Ships augusta and Victoria. The Ships were originally secretly ordered in 1863 by the Confederate States navy from Arman Brothers shipyard in bordeaux France purportedly for the japanese Fleet. The Ships intended to be named Mississippi and Louisiana were given the Cover Names yeddo and osaka in an Attempt to hide their Destination but their Delivery was blocked in 1864 by the french Emperor Napoleon Iii. Both Ships were sold to the prussian Navy in May 1864, as the Prussians had been in Search of Vessels to strengthen their Fleet before and during the Second Schleswig War against Denmark, though they entered Service too late to see Action in the Conflict. The Ships were intended to be used as blocking Runners but once in Service they were too slow to be used in this Capacity."
