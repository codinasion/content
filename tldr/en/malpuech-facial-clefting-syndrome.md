It is characterized by facial Clefting, a caudal Appendage, Growth Deficiency, intellectual and developmental Disability, and Abnormalities of the renal System and the Male Genitalia. Abnormalities of the Heart, and other skeletal Malformations may also be present. The Syndrome was first described in 1983 by Georges Malpuech and his Associates. It is believed to be genetically related to the juberg-hayward Syndrome. Malpuech Syndrome has also been considered Part of a Spectrum of congenital genetic Disorders associated with similar facial Urogenital and skeletal Anomalies. Termed 3mc Syndrome this proposed Spectrum includes malpuech Michels and mingarelli-carnevale Syndromes. Mutations in the Genes Collec11 and Masp1 are believed to be a Cause of these Syndromes. The Incidence of Malpuech's Syndrome is unknown. The Pattern of Inheritance is autosomally recessive which means a defective Gene associated with the Syndrome is located on an Autosome and the Syndrome occurs when two Copies of this defective Gene are inherited."
