short_summary: "Four largest moons of Jupiter"
description: "Galilean Moons or galilean Satellites are the four largest Moons of Jupiter Io Europa Ganymede and Callisto. They are the most readily visible Solar System objects after the unaided visible Saturn, the dimmest of the classical planets, allowing observation with common binoculars, even under night sky conditions of high light pollution. The Invention of the Telescope enabled the Discovery of the Moons in 1610. They became the first Objects discovered in the Solar System since Humans have started tracking the classical Planets and the first to orbit a Planet beyond Earth."
