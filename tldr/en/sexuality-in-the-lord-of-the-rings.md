short_summary: "Representation of sexuality in J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings"
description: "The Presence of Sexuality in the Lord of the Rings, a Bestselling Fantasy Novel by J. R. R. Tolkien, has been debated, as it is somewhat unobtrusive. However, love and marriage appear in the form of the warm relationship between the hobbits Sam Gamgee and Rosie Cotton; the unreturned feelings of Éowyn for Aragorn, followed by her falling in love with Faramir, and marrying him; and Aragorn's love for Arwen, described in an appendix rather than in the main text, as 'The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen'. Multiple Scholars have noted the Symbolism of the monstrous Female Spider Shelob. Interest in the officer-batman-inspired Same-Sex Relationship of Frodo and his Gardener Sam has also been concentrated as they travel together on the dangerous Quest to destroy the Ring. Scholars and Commentators have interpreted the Relationship in different Ways from close but not necessarily homosexual to plainly homoerotic or as idealised Heroic Friendship."
