title: "Phosphatase"
short_summary: "Enzyme which catalyzes the removal of a phosphate group from a molecule"
description: "A Phosphatase is an Enzyme that uses Water to cleave a Monoester of phosphoric Acid into a phosphate Ion and an Alcohol. Because a Phosphatase Enzyme catalyzes the Hydrolysis of its Substrate it is a Subcategory of Hydrolases. Phosphatase Enzymes are essential for many biological Functions because Phosphorylation and Dephosphorylation serve diverse Roles in cellular Regulation and signaling. Whereas phosphatases remove phosphate groups from molecules, kinases catalyze the transfer of phosphate groups to molecules from ATP. Together Kinases and Phosphatases direct a Form of post-translational Modification essential to the Cell's regulatory Network."
