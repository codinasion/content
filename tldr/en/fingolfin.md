He was threatened by his half-brother Fëanor, who held him in contempt for not being a pure-bred Noldor.

On Arrival he challenged dark Lord Morgoth at the Gates of his Fortress Angband but morgoth stayed inside. When his Son Fingon rescued maedhros Son of fanor Maedhros renounced his Claim to kingship and fingolfin became the high King of the Noldor. He was victorious at the Battle of Dagor Aglareb and there was Peace for some 400 Years until morgoth broke out and destroyed Beleriand in Dagor Bragollach. Fingolfin, receiving false News, rode alone to Angband and challenged Morgoth to single Combat. He wounded morgoth several Times but grew weary and was killed by immortal Vala."
