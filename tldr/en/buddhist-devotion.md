short_summary: "Devotional practices of Buddhists"
description: "Devotion, a central Practice in Buddhism, Refers to commitment to religious Observances or to an Object or Person, and may be translated with Sanskrit or Pāli Terms like Saddhā, Gārava or Pūjā. Central to buddhist Devotion is the Practice of Buddhnussati which is the Recollection of the inspiring Qualities of Buddha. Although Buddhnussati was an important Aspect of Practice since the early Period of Buddhism its Importance was amplified with the Development of Mahyna Buddhism. With pure Land Buddhism many Forms of Devotion were developed specifically to recollect and connect with the celestial Buddhas especially amitbha."
