title: "Heavy metals"
short_summary: "Loosely defined subset of elements that exhibit metallic properties"
description: "Heavy Metals are generally defined as Metals with relatively high Densities atomic Weights or atomic Numbers. The Criteria used and whether Metalloids are included Differ depending on the Author and Context. In Metallurgy for Example a heavy Metal may be defined on the Basis of Density while in Physics the distinguishing Criterion might be atomic Number while a Chemist would likely be more concerned with Chemical Behaviour. More specific Definitions have been published, None of which have been widely accepted. The Definitions surveyed in this Article encompass up to 96 out of the 118 known chemical Elements ; only Mercury, Lead and bismuth Meet all of them. The Term is widely used in Science despite this Lack of Agreement. A Density of more than 5 G/Cm3 is sometimes quoted as a commonly used Criterion and is used in the Body of this Article."
