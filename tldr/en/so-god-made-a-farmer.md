description: "So god made a Farmer was a Speech given by Radio Broadcaster Paul Harvey at the Convention of the future Farmers of America in 1978. The Speech was first published in Harvey's syndicated Column in 1986. The Speech borrowed a few Phrases from a 1975 Article written by Harvey in the gadsden Times and was inspired by Parts of a 1940 Definition of Dirt Farmer published in the Farmer-Stock. The Article was copied Verbatim by Tex Smith in 1949 in a Letter to the Editor of the ellensburg daily Record. The Speech was given as an Extension of the Genesis Creation Narrative in Reference to god's Actions on the 8th Day of the Creation. Harvey described the Characteristics of a Farmer in each Phrase, ending them with the recurring 'so God made a Farmer'."
