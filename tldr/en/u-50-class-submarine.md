description: "The u-50 Class was a Class of four ocean-going Subs or U-Boats planned for the austro-hungarian Navy during World War I. The Design of the Boats was based on the Project 835 Design purchased in July 1915 from the german Firm Germaniawerft. The navy authorized Ganz Danubius to begin Construction of the Submarines in Fiume in february 1916. Only two of the four planned Boats were laid down but None were ever launched or completed. The two incomplete Submarines were abandoned after the War."
