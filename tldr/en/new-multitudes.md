The Project was initiated by Woody's Daughter Nora Guthrie to have Farrar add Music to her Father's lyricsâ€”specifically, his earliest songwriting Years in Los Angeles. Over the Course of several Years he invited the other People to collaborate and recorded at a Variety of Locations across the united States. Each Artist wrote Music to Lyrics that inspired him and presented it to the Collaborators for recording. The Result is an Album with diverse musical Genres that has garnered positive Reviews from Critics for its varied Styles and Instruments. The Quartet promoted the Album with a small promotional Tour that took them to record Stores, Radio Programs, Theaters, and Folk Festivals. The Group has plans for a second Volume."
