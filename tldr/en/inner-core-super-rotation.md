short_summary: "Concept in geodynamics"
description: "Inner Core Super-Rotation is the eastward Rotation of the inner Core of Earth relative to its Mantle for a net Rotation Rate that is usually faster than earth as a Whole. A 1995 Model of Earth's Dynamo predicted Super-Rotations of up to 3 Degrees per Year the following Year this Prediction was supported by observed Discrepancies in the Time it takes for P-Waves to travel."
