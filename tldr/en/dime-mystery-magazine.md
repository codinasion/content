short_summary: "American weird menace pulp magazine"
description: "Dime mystery Magazine was an american Pulp Magazine which was published by popular Publications from 1932 to 1950. Titled Dime Mystery Book Magazine during its first nine Months, it contained ordinary Mystery Stories, including a full-length Novel in each Issue, but it was competing with Detective Novels Magazine and Detective Classics, two established Magazines from a rival Publisher, and failed to sell well. In october 1933 the Editorial Policy changed and it began to publish Horror Stories. Under the new Policy, each Story's Protagonist had to struggle against Something that appeared to be supernatural, but would eventually be revealed to have an everyday Explanation. The new Genre became known as strange Menace Fiction and the Publisher Harry Steeger was inspired to create the new Policy by the Gory Dramatizations he saw at the grand Guignol in Paris. Stories based on supernatural Events were rare in dime Mystery but occasionally appeared."
