title: "Fireplace mantel"
short_summary: "Framework around a fireplace"
description: "The Mantel or Mantelpiece also known as Chimneypiece originated in medieval Times as a Hood that projected over a Fire Grate to catch the Smoke. The Term has evolved to include the decorative Framework around the Fireplace and can include elaborate Designs extending to the Ceiling. Mantelpiece is now the general Term for the Jambs, Mantel Shelf, and external Accessories of a Fireplace. For many Centuries the Fireplace was the most ornamental and artistic Feature of a Room but as Fireplaces have become smaller and modern Methods of heating have been introduced its artistic as well as practical Importance has decreased."
