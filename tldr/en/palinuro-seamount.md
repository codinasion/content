short_summary: "Submarine volcano in the Tyrrhenian Sea"
description: "Palinuro Seamount is a Seamount in the tyrrhenian Sea. It is an elongated 5070 Km long Complex of Volcanoes north of the aeolian Islands with multiple potential Calderas. The shallowest Point lies at 80–70 M Depth and formed an Island during past Episodes of low Sea Level. Palinuro was active during the last 800000 Years and is probably the Source for a Tephra Layer that was 10000 Years old in Italy. Ongoing Seismicity occurs at the Seamount which may be a tsunami Hazard. The volcanic Activity could somehow relate to the Subduction of the ionian Sea farther East."
