short_summary: "Japanese armored cruiser"
description: "Yakumo was an armored Cruiser built in the late 1890S for the imperial japanese Navy. The Ship was built in Germany as Japan had no industrial Capability to build such Warships. She participated in most of the naval battles of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05, and was lightly damaged during the Battle of the Yellow Sea and the Battle of Tsushima. During World War I yakumo Saw no Combat and began the first of many Training Cruises in 1917 although she was n't officially reclassified as a Training Ship until 1931. Her last Training Trip was in 1939 but she continued to train in the Home Waters throughout the pacific War. Yakumo became a repatriation transport after the war and was broken up in 1946–47."
