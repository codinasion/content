short_summary: "Former prison in Fremantle, Western Australia"
description: "Fremantle Prison, sometimes referred to as Fremantle Gaol or Fremantle Jail, is a former Australian Prison and World Heritage Site in Fremantle, Western Australia. The Site includes the Prison Cellblocks, Gatehouse, Perimeter Walls, Cottages, and Tunnels. It was initially used for Convicts transported from Britain but was transferred to the colonial Government in 1886 for local Sentences for Prisoners. In 1898 and 1911 the Royal Commissions took Place and introduced a Reform to the Prison System but significant Changes did not begin until the 1960S. The Government Department in Charge of the Prison underwent several Reorganisations in the 1970s and 1980s, but the Culture of Fremantle Prison was resistant to change. Growing Prisoner Discontent culminated in a 1988 Riot with Guards taken Hostage, and a Fire that caused $ 1. 8 million Worth of Damage. The Prison was closed in 1991 replaced by the new maximum Security Casuarina Prison."
