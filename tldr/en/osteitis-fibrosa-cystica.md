short_summary: "Medical condition"
description: "Osteitis Fibrosa Cystica is a skeletal Disorder resulting in Loss of Bone Mass a Weakening of Bones as their calcified Supporting Structures are replaced with fibrous Tissue and Formation of cyst-like brown Tumors in. Osteitis Fibrosis Cystica, also known as Osteitis Fibrosa, osteodystrophia Fibrosa, and Von Recklinghausen's Disease of Bone, is caused by Hyperparathyroidism, which is a Surplus of parathyroid Hormone from over-active parathyroid Glands. This Surplus stimulates the Activity of Osteoclasts Cells that break down Bone in a Process known as osteoclastic Bone Resorption. Hyperparathyroidism can be triggered by parathyroid Adenoma hereditary Factors parathyroid Carcinoma or renal Osteodystrophy. Osteoclastic Bone Resorption releases Minerals including Calcium from the Bone into the Bloodstream causing elevated Blood Calcium Levels and structural Changes which weaken the Bone. The Symptoms of the Disease are the Consequences of both the general Softening of the Bones and excess Calcium in the Blood and include Bone Fractures kidney Stones nausea moth-eaten Appearance in the Bones appetite Loss and weight Loss."
