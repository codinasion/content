description: "Sms Szent Istvn was the last of four dreadnought Battleships of the Tegetthoff Class that were built for the austro-hungarian Navy. Szent Istv치n was the only Ship of her Class to be built within the hungarian Part of the austro-hungarian Empire, a Concession made to the hungarian Government in Return for its Support for the 1910 and 1911 naval Budgets which funded the Tegetthoff Class.

She was launched two Years later in 1914, but Szent Istv치n's Construction was delayed due to the smaller Shipyards in Fiume, and further delayed by the Outbreak of World War i in July 1914. She was finally commissioned in December 1915 in the austro-hungarian Navy."
