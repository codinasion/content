short_summary: "Vitamin used in animal cells' metabolism"
description: "Vitamin B12 also known as Cobalamin is a water-soluble Vitamin involved in Metabolism. It is one of eight B Vitamins. It is required by Animals that use it as Cofactor in Dna Synthesis and in both amino Acid and fatty Acid Metabolism. It is important in the normal Functioning of the nervous System via its Role in the Synthesis of Myelin and the Circulatory System in the Maturation of red Blood Cells in the Bone Marrow. Plants do n't need Cobalamin and carry out Reactions with Enzymes that are not dependent on it."
