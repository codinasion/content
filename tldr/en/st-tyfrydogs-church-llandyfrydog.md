description: "St Tyfrydog's Church, Llandyfrydog is a small Medieval Church, in Llandyfrydog, Anglesey, north Wales. The Date of Establishment of a Church on this Site is unknown but one Anglesey Historian from the 19th Century says it was about 450. The oldest Parts of the present Building are dated about 1400 with the Chancel dating from the late 15th or early 16th Century. It is constructed from small Rough squared Stones covered with Limestone. One of the Windows on the south Side is raised to illuminate the Pulpit a Decision that disfigures the Building in the Eyes of one 19th-century Commentator."
