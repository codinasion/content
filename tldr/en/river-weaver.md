short_summary: "River in Cheshire, England"
description: "The River Weaver is a River, navigable in its lower Reaches, running in a curving Route Anti-Clockwise across West Cheshire, northern England. Improvements to the River were authorised in 1720 and in 1732 the Work which included eleven Locks was completed. An unusual Clause in the enabling Act of Parliament stipulated that Profits should be given to the County of Cheshire for the Improvement of Roads and Bridges but Navigation was not initially profitable and it was 1775 before the first Payments were made. Trade continued to rise, and by 1845, over Â£500,000 had been given to the County."
