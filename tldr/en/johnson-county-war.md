description: "The johnson County War also known as the War on Powder River and the wyoming Range War was a Range Conflict that took Place between 1889 and 1893 in johnson County Wyoming. The Conflict began when cattle Companies began persecuting alleged Rustlers in the Region many of whom were Settlers who competed with them for Livestock Land and Water Rights. As Violence between large established Ranchers and the smaller Settlers in the State swelled it culminated in the Powder River Country when the former hired Gunmen to invade the County. The initial Incursion of the Gunmen into the Territory alerted small Farmers and Ranchers as well as the State Lawmen and they formed a Posse of 200 Men that led to a grueling Stand-Off. The Siege ended when the united States cavalry relieved the two Forces under the Orders of President Benjamin harrison although further fighting persisted in the following Months."
