title: "Confounding"
short_summary: "Variable or factor in causal inference"
description: "In Causal Inference a Confounder is a variable which affects both the independent variable and dependent variable causing a spurious Association. Confounding is a Causal Concept and can not be described in Terms of Correlations or Associations. The Existence of Confounders is an important quantitative Explanation of the Fact that Correlation does not imply Causation. Some Notations are explicitly designed to identify the Existence, possible Existence, or Non-Existence of Confounders in causal Relationships between Elements of a System."
