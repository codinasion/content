short_summary: "1992 EP by Codeine"
description: "Barely real is the extended Play of the american Indie Rock Band Codeine 1992. After releasing their previous Album frigid Stars lp in 1990 the Group accepted an Invitation from the Quartet Bastro in 1991 to tour Europe. Following the tour the Group was invited to record a single for sub Pop Singles Club and attempted in 1992 to record their follow-up album the white Birch. The Recording Sessions proved to be disastrous for the Group since they often had unusable Tracks across several Studios. As Codeine was unable to record enough Material for a full-length Album they decided to release what they had as an Ep."
