title: "Aqueous solution"
short_summary: "Solution in which the solvent is water"
description: "An aqueous Solution is a Solution in which the Solvent is Water. It is mostly shown in Chemical Equations by appending to the relevant Chemical Formula. For Example, a Solution of table Salt, also known as Sodium Chloride, in Water would be represented as Na+ + Clâˆ’. The Word aqueous means pertaining to, related to, similar to, or dissolved in, Water. As Water is an excellent Solvent and is also naturally abundant it is an ubiquitous Solvent in Chemistry. Since Water is often used in Experiments as the Solvent the Word Solution Refers to an aqueous Solution unless the Solvent is specified."
