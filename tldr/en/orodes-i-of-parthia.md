short_summary: "Great King, Arsaces"
description: "Orodes I was king of the parthian Empire from 80 to 75 Bc. He was the Son and Heir to gotarzes I. His Reign is relatively unknown. His Throne may have been usurped by his supposed Uncle Mithridates iii in 8780 Bc but this has found little Support in Scholarship. Of his military activities, it is known that Orodes I re-established Parthian rule in Elymais in 78 BC, which had been independent since 81/80 BC. Orodes i later lost the Throne to the aged parthian Prince Sinatruces who belonged to a different Branch of the royal Family Arsacid."
