description: "Skull Tower is a Stone Structure embedded with human Skulls located in Niš, Serbia. It was built by the ottoman Empire following the Battle of Egar in may 1809 during the first Serb Uprising. During the Battle serbian Rebels under Command of Stevan Sineli were surrounded by the Ottomans on Egar Hill near Ni. Knowing that he and his Fighters would be impaled if captured, Sinđelić detonated a Powder Magazine within the rebel Entrenchment, killing himself, his Subordinates and the encroaching Ottoman Soldiers. Hurshid Pasha Governor of Rumelia ordered that a Tower be made from the Skulls of fallen Rebels. The tower is 4. 5 Metres high, and originally contained 952 Skulls embedded on four Sides in 14 Rows."
