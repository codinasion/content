title: "Siege of Kamarja"
short_summary: "Battle fought in 729 CE"
description: "The Siege of Kamarja was fought in 729 by the arab Muslims of the umayyad Caliphate and trgesh Khaganate together with its soghdian Allies. The umayyad Conquest of Transoxiana had been undone in the 720s by the Rebellions of local soghdian Princes and the trgesh Invasions. In 729 the small Fort of Kamarja near Samarkand was one of the last remaining Arab Strongholds in Transoxiana when it was attacked by the Trgesh under the personal Direction of their Ruler Suluk. The subsequent Siege, for which a detailed Account Survives in the History of Al-Tabari, lasted for 58 Days and ended with the negotiated Withdrawal of its Garrison to Samarkand. The stubborn Defence of Kamarja was celebrated in arabic Literature but the arab Hold over the Region was broken two Years later after the Battle of the Defile. After the Collapse of trgesh Khaganate in 738 the Arabs reestablished their Rule over Transoxiana."
