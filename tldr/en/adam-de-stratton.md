short_summary: "English moneylender"
description: "Adam de Stratton was a royal Moneylender Administrator and Clergyman under Edward I of England. He advanced professionally through the Patronage of the Earls of Devon and became Chamberlain of the Exchequer and Steward of Isabella Count of Devon. At the same Time he made himself an enormous Fortune through Money Lending primarily through Debts from jewish Money Lenders. His Business Methods were often dubious and often involved various illegal Activities. He fell Victim to an Investigation of Corruption in the royal Administration in 1290 and was held in Prison from 1292 until his Death no later than 1294.
