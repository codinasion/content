title: "Siege of Kamacha"
short_summary: "Part of the Arabâ€“Byzantine Wars"
description: "The Siege of Kamacha by the Abbasid Caliphate took Place in Autumn 766 and involved the Siege of the strategically important Byzantine Fortress of Kamacha on the eastern Bank of the Euphrates River as well as a large-scale Raid across eastern Cap. Both Enterprises failed with the Siege dragging on into Winter before being abandoned and the raiding Force surrounded and defeated heavily by the Byzantines. The Campaign was one of the first large-scale Abbasid Operations against Byzantium and is one of the few Campaigns of the arab-byzantine Wars for which detailed Information survives although it is barely mentioned in Arabic or in."
