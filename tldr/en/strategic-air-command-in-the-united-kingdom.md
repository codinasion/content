description: "Between 1948 and 1992 the united States air force strategic Air Command Personnel and Aircraft were routinely deployed to Bases in England. An informal Agreement to base Sac Bombers in the Uk was reached in July 1946 between us general Carl Spaatz and the Marshal of the Royal Air Force Lord Tedder. At the Time there were only three Bases in the Uk which were considered suitable for operating boeing b-29 Superfortresses raf lakenheath Raf Marham and Raf Sculthorpe. These were Air Bases extended during World War Ii when it was planned to use b-29s against Germany. Two b-29 Groups were deployed to the Uk when the Berlin Blockade started in June 1948 but neither was equipped with silverplate Bombers capable of carrying nuclear Weapons. Nuclear-capable boeing b-50 Superfortress Bombers began deploying in 1949 and nuclear Bombs were used in 1950."
