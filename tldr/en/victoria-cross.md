description: "The Victoria Cross is the highest and most prestigious Decoration of the british Honours System. It is awarded to Members of the british armed Forces for a Performance in the Presence of the Enemy and may be awarded posthumously. It was previously awarded by Countries of the Commonwealth of Nations, most of which have established their own Honours Systems and no longer recommend british Honours. It may be awarded to a Person of any military Rank in any Service and to Civilians under military Command. Since 1879 there has never been a civilian Recipient. Since the first Awards were presented in 1857 by queen Victoria two Thirds of all Awards have been personally presented by the british Monarch.
