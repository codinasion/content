title: "Tropical Storm Colin (2016)"
short_summary: "Atlantic tropical storm in 2016"
description: "Tropical Storm Colin was the earliest Third named Storm in the Atlantic Basin on Record for four Years, until it was surpassed by Tropical Storm Cristobal in 2020. An atypical poorly organized tropical Cyclone Colin developed from a low Pressure Area over the Gulf of Mexico near the northern Coast of the yucatn Peninsula late on 5 June 2016. Moving northward the Depression strengthened into a tropical Storm about eight Hours after its Formation. Colin curved north-northeast on June 6 and intensified slightly to 50 Mph Winds. Strong Wind Shear prevented further Strengthening and resulted in the System maintaining a disheveled Appearance on Satellite Imagery. Later the Storm began accelerating to the Northeast. On June 7 Colin made Landfall in rural Taylor County Florida still at peak Intensity. The System was moving rapidly across northern Florida and appeared into the atlantic ocean several Hours later. Colin transversed into an extratropical Cyclone offshore north Carolina late on June7 before being absorbed by a frontal boundary the following Day."
