short_summary: "Lighthouse in Connecticut, United States"
description: "Chester Rock Light was a Light in Chester, Connecticut on the Connecticut River. It was built in 1889 as Part of a 15000 Appropriation by the united States Congress. The 21-foot tall wooden hexagonal pyramidal tower had a black lantern with a 6th order Fresnel lens. The Light was first Lit on 1 July 1889. In 1912 the Tower was replaced by a Skeleton Tower which was modified in 1927. Records do not show the Deactivation or Destruction of the Light but it was believed to have been removed in the 1930s. The deep River historical Society of deep River Connecticut wanted to build a Replica of the Structure for Use as a Daymark."
