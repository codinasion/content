short_summary: "King of Madagascar"
description: "Radama Ii was the Son and Heir of queen Ranavalona I and ruled over the Kingdom of Madagascar from 1861 to 1863 which controlled virtually the whole Island. Although Brief the Rule of Radama was a pivotal Period in the History of the Kingdom of Madagascar. Under the Unyielding and often harsh 33-year Rule of his Mother queen Ranavalona I Madagascar had successfully preserved its cultural and political Independence from european Colonial Designs. Radama Ii allowed religious Freedom and reopened Madagascar to european Influence by rejecting the Queen's Isolationism and Persecution of Christians. Under the Terms of the Lambert Charter, which Radama secretly contracted in 1855 with french Entrepreneur Joseph-François Lambert while Ranavalona still ruled, the french were awarded exclusive Rights to the Exploitation of large Tracts of valuable Land and other lucrative Resources and Projects. This Agreement which was later revoked by prime Minister Rainilaiarivony was key to establishing France's Claim over madagascar as a Protectorate and as a Colony in 1896."
