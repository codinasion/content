description: "Soil Series are a Level of Classification in the Hierarchy of the usda Soil Taxonomy Classification System as derived from the national cooperative Soil Survey of the united States Department of Agriculture natural Resources Conservation Service. The actual Object of Classification is the so-called Pedon or Soil individual. Soil Series Consist of Pedons that are grouped together because of their similar Pedogenesis, Soil Chemistry, and physical Properties. More specifically, each Series consists of Pedons having Soil Horizons that are similar in Soil Color, Soil Texture, Soil Structure, Soil Ph, Consistence, Mineral and Chemical Composition, and Arrangement in the Soil Profile. These Result in Soils that perform similarly for Land Use Purposes."
