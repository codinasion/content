It is a spiritual Successor to Star Wars: Rogue Squadron released two Years earlier. Despite the Similarities between the two Games the Development Team developed a new Game Engine for Battle for Naboo and included Land and water-based Combat as well as aerial Combat. The Player can control various Air, Land, and Water Vehicles ; each offers a unique Armament Arrangement, as well as varying Degrees of Speed and Maneuverability. Bonus Power-Ups that improve these Crafts' Weapons or Durability are hidden in different Levels throughout the Game. The Player's Performance is checked against four Medal Benchmarks after the Completion of each Level. Acquiring these Medals promotes the Player's Ranking and helps unlock Hidden Content."
