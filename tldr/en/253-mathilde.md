short_summary: "Asteroid"
description: "Mathilde is an Asteroid in the intermediate Asteroid Belt around 50 Kilometers in Diameter which was discovered on november 12 1885 by austrian Astronomer Johann Palisa at vienna Observatory. It has a relatively elliptical Orbit that takes more than four Years to circle the Sun. This tumbling Asteroid has an unusually slow Rate of Rotation that requires 17. 4 Days to complete a 360° Revolution about its Axis. It is a primitive c-type Asteroid, which means the Surface has a high Proportion of Carbon ; giving it a dark Surface that reflects only 4 % of the Light that falls on it."
