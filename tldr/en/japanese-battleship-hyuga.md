short_summary: "Ise-class battleship"
description: "Hyga was the second and last Battleship of the Ise Class built for the imperial japanese Navy during the 1910s. Although finished in 1918 she played no Role in World War I. Hyga supported japanese Forces in the early 1920s during siberian Intervention in the russian civil War. In 1923 she helped Survivors of the great kant Earthquake. The Ship was partially modernised in two Stages in 1927–1928 and 1931–1932, during which her Forward Superstructure was rebuilt in the Pagoda Mast Style. Hyūga was reconstructed in 1934–1936, improvements being made to her armour and propulsion machinery. She later played a minor Role in the second sino-japanese War."
