description: "Sappho was an archaic greek Poet from Eresos or Mytilene on the Island of Lesbos. Sappho is known for her lyric Poetry written to be sung while accompanied by Music. Sappho was regarded as one of the greatest lyric Poets in ancient Times and was given Names such as the Tenth Muse and the Poetess. Most of Sappho's Poetry is now lost and what is extant has mostly survived in fragmentary Form only the Ode to aphrodite is certainly complete. As well as lyric Poets ancient Commentators claimed that sappho wrote elegiac and iambic Poetry. Three Epigrams formerly attributed to Sappho are extant but these are in Fact hellenistic Imitations of Sappho's Style."
