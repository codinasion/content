It is one of two Species in the Genus molossops the other being the rufous dog-faced Bat. Three Subspecies are often recognized though Mammalogist Judith Eger Considers it monotypic with no Subspecies. It is a small free-tailed Bat, with a forearm Length of 28. 9–32. 5 Mm and a Weight of 5–8 G ; Males are larger than Females. It is brown, with paler belly fur and darker back fur. Its Wings are unusual for a free-tailed Bat with exceptionally wide Wingtips. Additionally, it has low wing Loading, meaning that it has a large wing Surface Area Relative to its Body Weight. Thus it flies more similar to a Vesper Bat than to other Species in its own Family. As it forages at Night for its Insect Prey, including Moths, Beetles, and Others, it uses two Kinds of frequency-modulated Echolocation calls: one Type is to navigate in open Areas and to search for Prey, while the other Type is used for navigating in cluttered Areas or while approaching a prey Item."
