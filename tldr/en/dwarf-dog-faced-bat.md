Its Wings are unusual for a free-tailed Bat with exceptionally wide Wingtips. Additionally, it has low wing Loading, meaning that it has a large wing Surface Area Relative to its Body Weight. Thus it flies more similar to a Vesper Bat than to other Species in its own Family. As it forages at Night for its Insect Prey, including Moths, Beetles, and Others, it uses two Kinds of frequency-modulated Echolocation calls: one Type is to navigate in open Areas and to search for Prey, while the other Type is used for navigating in cluttered Areas or while approaching a prey Item."
