short_summary: "2016 wildfire in California"
description: "The Sherpa Fire was a Wildfire which in June 2016 burned in the Santa Ynez mountains along the Gaviota Coast in southwestern Santa Barbara County California. The Fire Spread to over 1400 Acres in a Matter of Hours as the Fire was propelled by Downslope Sundowner Winds. This offshore northerly Wind Contrasts with the more typical Onshore Flow and sent the Fire into the Canyons at a Rate of over 35 Miles per Hour. The Fire resulted in Evacuations at two State Beach Campgrounds and some Residences as well as an intermittent Interruption of Traffic on a State Transportation Route."
