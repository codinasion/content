short_summary: "Carrier-based bomber aircraft"
description: "The north american Aj Savage is an american carrier-based Medium Bomber built for the united States navy by north american Aviation. The Aircraft was designed shortly after World War Ii to carry atomic Bombs and this meant the Bomber was the heaviest Aircraft so far designed to operate from an Aircraft Carrier. It was powered by two Piston Engines and a Turbojet in the rear Fuselage. The first Aj-1 was operational in 1950 and several were based in south Korea during 1953 as a Deterrent against north Korea. Of the 140 Built plus three Prototypes 30 were Reconnaissance Aircraft. Inflight-refueling Equipment was deployed on the Savage in the Mid-1950S. The bomber was replaced by the Douglas A3D Skywarrior beginning in 1957. The Type was used for some additional Experiments after its military Service including Microgravity Test Flights and for testing a new Jet Engine in the 1960S and 70s."
