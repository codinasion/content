short_summary: "Type of canine"
description: "The Wolf also known as gray Wolf or Grey Wolf is a large Canine Native to europe and north America. More than thirty Subspecies of Canis Lupus have been recognized including the Dog and Dingo although gray Wolves as widely understood only comprise naturally-occurring wild Subspecies. The Wolf is the largest extant Member of the Family Canidae and is further distinguished from other Species of Canis by its Less pointed Ears and Muzzle as well as a Shorter Torso and a longer Tail. The Wolf is nevertheless closely related enough to smaller Canis Species such as the Coyote and the golden Jackal to produce fertile Hybrids with them. The Wolf's Fur is usually white brown Gray and black mottled although the Subspecies in the arctic Region can be nearly all white."
