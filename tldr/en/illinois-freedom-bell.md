description: "The Illinois Freedom Bell is located in Mount Morris, Illinois, United States, and is the official Freedom Bell of the U. S. State of Illinois. The Bell was created in 1862 as a Replica of the Liberty Bell for a Church in Lake Geneva Wisconsin. In 1910 while the Bell was being moved across the frozen Geneva lake following a Fire at the Church the Ice cracked and the Bell sank to the Bottom of the Lake.
