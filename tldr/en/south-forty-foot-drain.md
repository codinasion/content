short_summary: "Drainage canal in eastern England"
description: "The south forty-foot Drain also known as black Sluice Navigation is the main Channel for the Land-Drainage of the black Sluice Level in the Lincolnshire Fens. It is located between the Guthram Gowt and the black Sluice pumping Station on the Haven in Boston in eastern England. The Drainage originates in the 1630s when the first Scheme to make fen Land available for Agriculture was carried out by Earl of Lindsey and has been continuously improved since then. Water that drained of the Land entered the Haven at certain tide States through Gravity until the black Sluice pumping Station was commissioned in 1946."
