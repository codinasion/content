title: "Dryopithecus"
short_summary: "Extinct great ape from Europe"
description: "Dryopithecus is a Genus of extinct large Apes from the middle-late Miocene Boundary of Europe 12. 5 to 11. 1 million Years ago. The Genus has been subject to taxonomic Turmoil since its Discovery in 1856 with numerous new Species from single Remains based on Minute Differences amongst each other being described and the fragmentary Nature of the holotype Specimen makes differentiating Remains difficult. There is currently only one uncontested Species, the Type species D. Fontani, though there may be more. The Genus is placed into the Tribe Dryopithecini, which is either an Offshoot of Orangutans, African apes, or is its own separate Branch."
