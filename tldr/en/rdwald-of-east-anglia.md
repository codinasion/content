short_summary: "Bretwalda"
description: "Rdwald also known as Raedwald or Redwald was a King of east Anglia an anglo-saxon Kingdom which included the present-day english Counties of Norfolk and Suffolk. He was the Son of Tytila of east Anglia and a Member of the Wuffingas Dynasty who were the first Kings of east Angles. Details about Rdwald's Reign are primarily scarce because the viking Invasions of the 9th Century destroyed the Monasteries in east Anglia where many Documents would have been. From about 599 until his Death around 624 Rdwald initially ruled under the Overlordship of Thelberht of Kent. As a Result of fighting the Battle of the idle River and defeating Thelfrith of Northumbria he was able to install Edwin who was Acquiescent to his Authority as the new King of Northum. During the Battle both Thelfrith and Rdwald's Son rgenhere were killed."
