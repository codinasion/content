Over the next Twenty Years the Claim of sultan Ali in the Office of Sultan of Johor was only acknowledged by some Merchants and a few Malaysians. Like his Father, Sultan Ali's was much of a Puppet Monarch and played a minimal Role in the administrative Affairs of the State, which came under the Charge of the Temenggong and the british. In 1855 Sultan Ali ceded the Sovereignty Rights of Johor to temenggong Daeng Ibrahim in Exchange for a formal Recognition by the british as the Sultan of Johor and a monthly Allowance. Following the Secession of Johor Sultan Ali was granted administrative Charge over Muar until his Death in 1877 and was often styled as the Sultan of Muar in most administrative Matters."
