description: "The linois Expedition to the indian Ocean was a Raiding Operation launched during the napoleonic Wars by the french Navy. In March 1803 Captain charles-alexandre Durand Linois was ordered to the indian Ocean in his Flagship Marengo accompanied by a Squadron of three Frigates shortly before the End of the Peace of Amiens. When War broke out between Britain and France in september 1803 Marengo was with the Frigates at Pondicherry but escaped a british Squadron sent to intercept him and reached the Isle de France. The large Distances between naval Bases in the indian Ocean and the limited Resources available to the british Commanders in the Region made it difficult to concentrate sufficient Forces to combat a Squadron of this Size and Linois subsequently was able to sustain his Campaign for three Years. Linois and his Frigates from the Isle de France began a Series of Attacks on british Commerce across the eastern indian Ocean specifically targeting the large Convoys of east Indiamen that were vital to the Maintenance of Trade within the british Empire and to the british Economy. Although he had a Number of Victories against individual Merchant Ships and the small british Trading Post of Bencoolen the first military Test of the Linois Squadron occurred at the Battle of pulo Aura on 15 february 1804. Linois attacked the undefended british China Fleet consisting of 16 valuable east Indiamen and 14 other Ships but failed to press his military Superiority and withdrew without capturing any Ship."
