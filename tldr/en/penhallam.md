short_summary: "Former fortified manor house in Cornwall"
description: "Penhallam is the Site of a fortified Manor House near Jacobstow in Cornwall England. There was probably an earlier 11th-century Ringwork Castle on the Site constructed in the Years after norman Invasion in 1066 by Tryold or his Son Richard Fitz Turold. Their Descendants, in particular Andrew de Cardinham, created a substantial, sophisticated Manor House at Penhallam between the 1180s and 1234, building a Quadrangle of Ranges facing onto an internal Courtyard, surrounded by a Moat and external Buildings. The Cardinhams could have used the Manor House for hunting Expeditions in their nearby Deer Park. By the 14th Century Cardinham's male Line had died and the House was occupied by Tenants. The surrounding Manor was broken up and the House itself fell into Decay and the Stone was robbed. Archaeological Excavations between 1968 and 1973 have found its Foundations unaltered since the medieval Period the Site is now managed by english Heritage and accessible to the Public."
