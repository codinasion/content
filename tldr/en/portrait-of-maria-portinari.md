short_summary: "Painting by Hans Memling"
description: "Portrait of Maria Portinari is a small c. 147072 Painting by Hans memling in Tempera and Oil on a Oak Panel. It presents maria Maddalena baroncelli about whom very little is known. She is about 14 Years old and depicted shortly before her Wedding to italian Banker Tommaso Portinari. Maria is dressed in the height of late fifteenth-century fashion, with a long black hennin with a transparent veil and an elaborate jewel-studded necklace. Her Headdress is similar and a necklace identical to those in her Depiction in Hugo Van Der Goes's later Portinari Altarpiece, a Painting that may have been partly based on Memling's Portrait."
