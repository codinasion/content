description: "Polikarpov I-185 was a soviet Fighter Aircraft designed in 1940. It was flown with three Engines but all of them either were not sufficiently developed for Service Use or their full Production was reserved for other Fighters already in Production. On 27 january 1943 the i-185 Program was cancelled. Engines used with the I-185 included the Shevstov M-71 which was more prominent and the Shevstov M-82 which was also used on lavochkin-la-5 Fighters. Only a few Variants of M-82 were produced."
