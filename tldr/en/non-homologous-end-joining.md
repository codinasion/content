short_summary: "Pathway that repairs double-strand breaks in DNA"
description: "Non-homologous End Joining is a Pathway that repairs Double-Strand Break in Dna. It is called 'non-homologous' because the Break Ends are directly ligated without the Need for a homologous Template, in Contrast to homology directed Repair, which requires a homologous Sequence to guide Repair. Nhej is active in both Proliferating and non-dividing Cells while Hdr is not readily accessible in non-dividing Cells. The Term non-homologous End Joining was coined by Moore and Haber in 1996."
