description: "Sartono was an indonesian Politician and Lawyer who served as the first Speaker of the People's representative Council from 1950 until 1960. Born into a noble ethnic-javanese Family Sartono studied Law at leiden University. During his Studies he joined the Perhimpoenan Indonesia Association and became a vocal Proponent of indonesian Independence. After graduating he opened a Law Firm and helped found the indonesian national Party in 1927. When several Party Leaders were arrested by the colonial Government in 1929 he became one of their Defense Lawyers and unsuccessfully argued for their Acquittal. Following the Arrest of its Leaders the Pni became paralyzed and the Party suspended its Activities in Consequence. In its Place, Sartono founded a new political Party, Partindo, which sought to achieve Independence through Non-Cooperation and Mass Action. Partindo lasted until 1936 when it decided to dissolve. After Partindo's Dissolution, Sartono helped found another Party, Gerindo, which advocated for the Creation of an indonesian Parliament."
