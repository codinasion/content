description: "Off Spin is a Type of Finger Spin Bowling in Cricket. A bowler who uses this technique is called an off spinner. Off Spinners are right-handed spin Bowlers who use their Fingers to spin the Ball. Their normal Delivery is an off Break which spins from left to right when the Ball Bounces on the Pitch. For a right-handed Batsman, this is from his off Side to the leg Side. The ball breaks away from the off side, hence the name 'off break'."
