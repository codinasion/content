description: "Edinburgh Castle is a historic Castle in Edinburgh, Scotland. It sits on Castle Rock which has been occupied by Humans since at least the Iron Age. There has been a royal Castle on the Rock since at least the Reign of Malcolm Iii in the 11th Century, and the Castle continued to be a royal Residence until 1633. The Castle's residential Role declined from the 15th Century and was principally used as a military Garrison by the 17th Century. Its Importance as Part of Scotland's national Heritage was increasingly recognized from the early 19th Century Onwards and various Restoration Programmes have been carried out over the past Century and a Half."
