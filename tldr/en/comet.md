title: "Comet"
short_summary: "Natural object in space that releases gas"
description: "A Comet is an Icy small solar System Body that warms and begins to release Gases when it passes close to the Sun a Process called Outgassing. This produces an extended gravitationally unbound atmosphere surrounding the Nucleus and sometimes a Tail of Gas and Dust Gas blown out of the Coma. These Phenomena are due to the Effects of solar Radiation and the out-going solar Wind Plasma acting on the Nucleus of the Comet. Nuclei of Comets range from a few hundred Meters to Tens of Kilometers across and are composed of loose Collections of Ice Dust and small rocky Particles. The Coma may be up to 15 Times Earth's Diameter, while the Tail may stretch beyond one astronomical Unit. If sufficiently close and bright, a Comet may be seen from Earth without the Aid of a Telescope and can subtend an Arc of up to 30Â° across the Sky. Comets have been observed and recorded by many Cultures and Religions since Ancient Times."
