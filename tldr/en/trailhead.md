short_summary: "Point at which a trail begins"
description: "A Trailhead is the Point at which a Trail begins, where the Trail is often intended for Hiking, Biking, Horseback Riding, or off-road Vehicles. Modern Trailheads often contain Restrooms Maps Signposts and Distribution Centers for informational Brochures about the Trail and its Features and parking Areas for Vehicles and Trailers. The united States Access Board states a Trailhead is defined as an outdoor Space designated as Access Point to the Trail by an Entity responsible for administering or maintaining the Trail. The Intersection of two Trails is a Junction and does not constitute a Trailhead."
