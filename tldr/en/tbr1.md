short_summary: "Protein-coding gene in Homo sapiens"
description: "T-box Brain 1 is a Transcription Factor Protein important for vertebrate Embryo Development. It is encoded by the Tbr1 Gene. This Gene is also known by several other Names: T-Brain 1, Tbr-1, Tes-56, and Mgc141978. Tbr1 is a Member of the tbr1 Subfamily of the t-box Family Transcription Factors which Share a common Dna-Binding Domain. Other Members of the tbr1 subfamily include Eomes and Tbx21. Tbr1 is involved in the Differentiation and Migration of Neurons and is required for normal Brain Development. Tbr1 Interacts with various Genes and Proteins in Order to regulate cortical Development specifically within the Layer Vi of the developing six-layered human Cortex. Studies show that Tbr1 may play a Role in major neurological Diseases such as Parkinson's Disease Alzheimer's Disease and Autism Spectrum Disorder."
