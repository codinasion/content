After his Work is done the Actor tells the Farmer to return Home and the Farmer finds he is liked and marries his Love Interest. The one-segment Comedy Production saw a wide us Release and was also released in the united Kingdom under an alternate Title the Actor and the Bumpkin. Reviews were positive and focused on good Acting and Originality in the Execution of a Plot, with the New York Clipper finding it a welcome Relief from the 'pie-smashing' Antics of other Comedies."
