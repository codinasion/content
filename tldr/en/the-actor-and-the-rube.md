This was written by Philip Lonergan and directed by arthur Ellery this was Falstaff's first Release. The Production was led by edwin Thanhouser and produced in the Studios in new Rochelle. The Plot of the Film is about a cranky Farmer who decided to flee from his entire Town. An Actor disguises himself as the Farmer and Returns to the Farmer's Village and makes him popular. After his Work is done the Actor tells the Farmer to return Home and the Farmer finds he is liked and marries his Love Interest. The one-segment Comedy Production saw a wide us Release and was also released in the united Kingdom under an alternate Title the Actor and the Bumpkin. Reviews were positive and focused on good Acting and Originality in the Execution of a Plot, with the New York Clipper finding it a welcome Relief from the 'pie-smashing' Antics of other Comedies."
