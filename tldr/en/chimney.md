description: "A Chimney is an architectural Ventilation Structure made of Masonry Clay or Metal that isolates from the human Living Areas the hot Toxic Exhaust Gases or Smoke produced by a Boiler Stove Furnace Incinerator or Fireplace. Chimneys are generally vertical or as close as possible to vertical to ensure that the Gases flow smoothly drawing Air into Combustion in what is known as the Stack Effect or Chimney Effect.
