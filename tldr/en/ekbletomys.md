description: "Ekbletomys Hypenemus is an extinct Oryzomyine Rodent from the Islands of Antigua and barbuda lesser Antilles. It was described as the only Species of the Subgenus Ekbletomys of the Genus Oryzomys in a Phd. D. But this Name is not available under the international Code of zoological Nomenclature and the Species remains unnamed. In the Absence of a formally available Name it is currently referred to as Ekbletomys Hypenemus. The Species is now thought to be extinct but Association with introduced Rattus indicates that it survived on Antigua until before 1500 Bce."
