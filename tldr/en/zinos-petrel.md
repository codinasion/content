short_summary: "Small seabird in the gadfly petrel genus"
description: "Zino's Petrel or Freira is a small Seabird endemic to the Island of Madeira in the Genus Gadfly Petrel. This long-winged Petrel has a Grey back and Wings with a dark W Mark across the Wings and a grey upper Tail. The Undersides of the Wings are blackish apart from a Triangle of white near the Front Edge of the Body and the belly is white with grey Flanks. It is very similar in Appearance to the slightly larger fea Petrel and separating these two macaronesian Species at Sea is very challenging. It was previously considered to be a Subspecies of the soft-plumaged Petrel P. Mollis, but they are not closely related, and Zino's was raised to the Status of a Species because of Differences in Morphology, calls, breeding Behaviour and mitochondrial Dna. It is one of Europe's most endangered Seabirds with breeding Areas restricted to a few Ledges high in the central Mountains of Madeira."
