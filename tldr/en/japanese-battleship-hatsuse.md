short_summary: "Japanese Shikishima-class battleship"
description: "Hatsuse was a pre-dreadnought Battleship of shikishima Class built in the late 1890S for the imperial japanese Navy. As Japan lacked the industrial Capacity to build such Warships the Ship was designed and built in the united Kingdom. She participated as the 1st Division's Flagship at the early Stages of the russo-japanese War of 1904-1905. Hatsuse was involved in subsequent naval Operations until she sank on may 15 1904 in a russian Minefield off Port Arthur after the ship struck two Mines. The Ship struck a Mine that caused significant Damage. Less than two Hours later the Ship struck a second Mine which detonated one of her Magazines and Hatsuse sank almost immediately with the Loss of over half the Crew."
