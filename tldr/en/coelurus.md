short_summary: "Extinct genus of dinosaurs"
description: "Coelurus is a Genus of coelurosaurian Dinosaur from the late jurassic Period. The Name means 'hollow Tail', referring to its hollow Tail Vertebrae. Although its Name is linked to one of the main Divisions of Theropods historically it has been poorly understood and sometimes confused with its better-known contemporary Ornitholestes. Like many Dinosaurs studied in the early Years of Paleontology it had a confusing taxonomic History with several Species being named and later transferred to other Genera or abandoned. Only one Species is currently recognized as Valid: the Type Species, C. Fragilis, described by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1879. It is known from one partial Skeleton found in the Morrison Formation in wyoming the united States. It was a small Bipedal Carnivore with elongated Legs."
