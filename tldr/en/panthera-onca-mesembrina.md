short_summary: "Extinct subspecies of carnivore"
description: "Panthera Onca Mesembrina is an extinct Subspecies of Jaguar that was endemic to patagonia in southern South America in the late Pleistocene Epoch. It is known from several fragmentary Specimens the first of which was found in Chile in cueva Del Milodon in 1899. These Fossils were referred to a new Genus and Species iemish Listai by naturalist Santiago roth who thought they might be the Bones of the mythological Iemisch of Tehuelche Folklor. A later Expedition recovered more Bones including the Skull of a large Male which was described in Detail in 1934 by Angel Cabrera. Cabrera created a new Name for giant felid remains panthera onca Mesembrina after realizing that its Fossils were near-identical to modern Jaguars. P. The Validity of onca Mesembrina is disputed with some Paleontologists suggesting it is a Synonym of Panthera Atrox."
