short_summary: "English industrial metal band"
description: "Godflesh are an english industrial Metal Band from Birmingham. The Group was founded under the original Name O. P. D. But did not release any complete Music until 1988 when Justin Broadrick and B. C. Green renamed the Band and decided to use a Drum Machine for the Percussion. Melding heavy Metal with industrial Music and later with electronic Music and Dub, Godflesh's Sound is widely regarded as a foundational Influence on other industrial Metal and post-metal Acts and as significant to both experimental and extreme Metal."
