short_summary: "American Protestant group formed in 1946"
description: "The evangelical united Brethren Church was a north american Protestant Denomination from 1946 until 1968 with arminian Theology Roots in the Mennonite and german reformed Communities and close Ties to methodism. It was formed through the Merger of the evangelical Church and the Church of the united Brethren in Christ. The united Brethren and the evangelical Association were planning to merge off and on since the early 19th Century because of their common Emphasis on Holiness and Evangelism and their common german Heritage. In 1968, the United States section of the EUB merged with the Methodist Church to form the United Methodist Church, while the Canadian section joined the United Church of Canada."
