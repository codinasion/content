The Voters of his District elected him anyway, but he was not allowed to take his Seat until the Congress' second Session, after he was of legal Age to serve. Kentucky Brown was elected in 1866 from this District after moving to henderson. He was denied his Seat this Time because of alleged Disloyalty to the Union during the civil War.
