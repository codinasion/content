title: "Cartesian tree"
short_summary: "Binary tree derived from a sequence of numbers"
description: "In Computer Science a cartesian Tree is a binary Tree derived from a Sequence of distinct Numbers. To construct the Cartesian Tree, set its Root to be the minimum Number in the Sequence, and recursively construct its Left and right Subtrees from the Subsequences before and after this Number. It is uniquely defined as a min-heap whose symmetric Traversal returns the original Sequence."
