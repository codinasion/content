description: "The Rllinge Statuette is a Statuette seated in Bronze found in Sdermanland Sweden in 1904 and dated to the Viking Age. The seven-centimetre-high Figure who wears a conical Headdress clasps his pointed Beard and has an erect Penis has been often assumed to be freyr. This is due to an 11th Century Description of a phallic Freyr Statue in the uppsala Temple but the Identification is uncertain."
