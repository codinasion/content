short_summary: "Non-diegetic speech in media"
description: "Voice-Over is a Production Technique where a Voice—That is not Part of the narrative —Is used in a Radio, Television Production, filmmaking, Theatre, or other Presentations. The Voiceover is read from a Script and may be spoken by Someone who appears elsewhere in the Production or by a specialist Voice Actor. Synchronous Dialogue where the Voice-Over narrates the Action that occurs at the same Time remains the most common Technique in Voice-Overs. Asynchronous, however, is also used in Cinema. It is usually pre-recorded and placed over the Top of a Film or Video and is frequently used to explain Information in Documentaries or News Reports."
