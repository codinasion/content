title: "Field goal percentage"
short_summary: "Statistic in basketball"
description: "Field Goal Percentage in Basketball is the Ratio of Field Goals completed to Field Goals attempted. Its Abbreviation is Fg %. Although the three-point Field Goal Percentage is often calculated separately three-point Field Goals are included in the general Field Goal Percentage. Instead of using Scales of 0 to 100 %, the Scale. 000 to 1. 000 is commonly used. A higher Field Goal Percentage implies a greater Efficiency. In Basketball, a Fg % of. 500 or above is considered a good Percentage, although this Criterion does not apply equally to all Positions. Guards usually have lower Fg % than Forwards and Centers. Field Goal Percentage does not completely tell the Skill of a Player, but a low Field Goal Percentage can indicate a poor offensive Player or a Player who takes many difficult Shots. In the Nba, Center Shaquille O'Neal had a high Career Fg % because he played near the Basket making many high Percentage Layups and Dunks. Allen Iverson had a low Fg often because he took the Bulk of his Team's Shots even with high Difficulty Shots."
