title: "BIT predicate"
short_summary: "Test of a specified bit in a binary number"
description: "In Mathematics and Computer Science the Bit predicate sometimes written is a Predicate which tests whether the th Bit of the Number is 1 when it is written as a binary Number. Its mathematical applications include modeling the membership relation of hereditarily finite sets, and defining the adjacency relation of the Rado graph. In Computer Science it is used for efficient Representations of set Data Structures using Bit Vectors in defining the private Information Retrieval Problem from Communication Complexity and descriptive Complexity Theory in Order to formulate logical Descriptions of Complexity Classes."
