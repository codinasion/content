description: "The presidency of Ulysses S. Grant began on March 4, 1869, when Ulysses S. Grant was inaugurated as the 18th President of the usa and ended on 4 March 1877. The Reconstruction Period took Place during Grant's two Terms in Office. The Ku Klux Klan caused widespread Violence against african Americans throughout the South. By 1870 all former Confederate States were readmitted to the united States and were represented in Congress. However, Democrats and former Slave Owners refused to accept that Freedmen were Citizens who were granted Suffrage by the Fifteenth Amendment, which prompted Congress to pass three Force Acts to allow the federal Government to intervene when States failed to protect former Slaves' Rights. Following an Escalation of Klan Violence in the late 1860S Grant and his attorney-general Amos T. Akerman the Head of the newly created Department of Justice began a Crackdown on Klan Activities in the south Starting in south Carolina where Grant sent federal Troops to capture Klan Members. This led the Klan to demobilize and helped ensure fair Elections in 1872."
