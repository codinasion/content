They are the first Installments of the third Generation of the Pokmon Video Game Series also known as the advanced Generation. After years of Nintendo being the sole publisher of the franchise in all regions, The Pokémon Company co-published the games for the first time since the establishment of the joint-owned company in 1998. They were first released in Japan in late 2002, and internationally in 2003. Pokémon Emerald, a third Version, was released two Years later in each Region. Remakes of the two Games, titled Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, were released for the Nintendo 3ds Worldwide in November 2014, exactly twelve Years to the Date of the original Ruby and Sapphire Release Date, with the Exception of Europe, where it released a Week later."
