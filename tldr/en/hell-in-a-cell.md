short_summary: "Professional wrestling match type"
description: "Hell in a Cell is a professional Wrestling Steel cage-based Match that originated in the W wrestling Federation in 1997. It features a large Cell Structure, a five-sided Cuboid made from open-weave Steel mesh Chain-Link Fencing which encloses the Ring and ringside Area. Unlike the Steel Cage Match, the only Way to get out of the Hell in a Cell without damaging the Cell's Structure is through its Doorâ€”But this Door is locked by Thick Chains and a Padlock. In typical Cases only an in-ring Pinfall or Submission will result in a Victory and there are no Disqualifications. The Gimmick was strongly associated with the Undertaker during his Career with Wwf/Wwe, including the inaugural Match with Shawn Michaels and a brutal Encounter with Mick Foley in his Mankind Persona. Both Matches featured spectacular Falls from the Top of the Cage which became a Signature of the Match."
