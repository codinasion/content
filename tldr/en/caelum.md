description: "Caelum is a faint Constellation in the southern Sky introduced by nicolas Louis de lacaille in the 1750s and counted among the 88 modern Constellations. Its Name means 'Chisel' in Latin, and it was formerly known as Caelum Sculptorium ; it is a rare Word, unrelated to the far more common Latin Caelum, meaning 'Sky', 'Heaven', or 'atmosphere'. It is the eighth-smallest constellation, and subtends a solid angle of around 0. 038 Steradians, just less than that of Corona Australis."
