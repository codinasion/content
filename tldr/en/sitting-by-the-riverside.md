short_summary: "1968 song by the Kinks"
description: "Sitting by the Riverside is a Song by the english Rock band the Kinks from their sixth Studio album the Kinks are the Village green Preservation Society. Written and sung by Ray Davies it was recorded in July 1968. The Song features a honky-tonk Piano and a Mellotron which mimics the Sound of an Accordion. The relaxed Tone of the Song is offset by the Sound of a swelling Cacophony between Verses a sound Reminiscent of the Crescendo in the Song from 1967 by the Beatles. The Song describes a pleasant Experience sitting beside a River and was inspired by Davies's Time spent as a Child Fishing with his Father."
