title: "Runestone"
short_summary: "Raised stone with a runic inscription"
description: "A Runestone is typically a raised Stone with a runic Inscription but the Term can also be applied to Inscriptions on Boulders and on Bedrock. The Tradition began in the 4th Century and lasts into the 12th Century but most Runestones Date from the late Viking Age. Most Runestones are located in Scandinavia but there are also scattered Runestones in Places that were visited by Norsemen during the Viking Age. Runestones are usually Memorials to dead Men. Runestones were usually bright when erected though this is no longer evident as the Colour has worn off. The Majority of Runestones are found in Sweden."
