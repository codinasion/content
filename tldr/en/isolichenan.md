title: "Isolichenan"
short_summary: "An α-glucan occurring in certain species of lichens"
description: "Isolichenan also known as Isolichenin is a cold-water soluble glucan found in various Species of Lichens. This lichen Product was first isolated in 1813 as a Component of an Extract of Iceland Moss together with Lichenin. After further Analysis and Characterization of the individual Components of the extract Isolichenan was named in 1881. It is the first α-glucan to be described from lichens. The presence of isolichenan in the cell walls is a defining characteristic in several genera of the lichen family Parmeliaceae. Although most widespread in that Family it has also been isolated from Members of the Families ramalinaceae stereocaulaceae Roccellaceae and Cladoniaceae. Experimental Studies have shown that Isolichenan is produced only when the two Lichen Components – fungus and alga – are growing together, not when grown separately. The biological Function of Isolichenan in the Lichen Thallus is unknown."
