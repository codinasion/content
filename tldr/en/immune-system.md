title: "Immune system"
short_summary: "Biological system protecting an organism against disease"
description: "The immune system is a network of biological systems that protects an organism from diseases. It detects and responds to a wide Variety of Pathogens, from Viruses to parasitic Worms, as well as Cancer Cells and Objects such as Wood Splinters, distinguishing them from the Organism's own healthy Tissue. Many Species have two major Subsystems of their Immune System. The innate immune system provides a preconfigured response to broad groups of situations and stimuli. The adaptive Immune System provides a tailored Response to each Stimulus by learning to recognize the Molecules it has encountered previously. Both use Molecules and Cells to perform their Functions."
