description: "Alamosa Lake is a former Lake in Colorado. It existed from the Pliocene through the middle Pleistocene in the san luis Valley fed by glacial Meltwater from the surrounding Mountain Ranges. Water Levels waxed and waned with the glacial Stages until at highstand the Lake reached an Elevation of 2,335 Meters and probably a Surface of over 4,000 square Kilometers, but only sparse Remains of the former Waterbody are visible Today. The Existence of the Lake was postulated in the early 19th Century and eventually proved in the early 20th Century."
