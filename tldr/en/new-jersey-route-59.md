short_summary: "State highway in Union County, New Jersey, US"
description: "Route 59, at 0. 15-mile long, is the shortest State Highway in New Jersey, United States. The Route consists entirely of a short Block of Lincoln Avenue from Union County Route 610 in Cranford to New Jersey Route 28 along the Cranfordâ€“Garwood Border. The Route Functions as an Underpass under the Raritan Valley Line of Nj Transit, under which it crosses about halfway down the Block, along the municipal Border. Route 59 was originally a proposed Alignment of Route 22, which was supposed to head from an Intersection with current Day New Jersey Route 159 in Morris County at the Pine Brook Bridge before heading through several Counties, terminating at an Intersection with New Jersey Route 27 in Rahway. Most of the route was not constructed, and a portion in Garwood and Cranford was re-designated Route 59 in the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering on January 1, 1953."
