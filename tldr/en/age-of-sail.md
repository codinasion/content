short_summary: "Historical era when sailing ships dominated global trade and warfare"
description: "The Age of Sail is a Period that lasted at the latest from the Mid-16Th to the mid-19th Centuries, in which the Dominance of sailing Ships in global Trade and Warfare culminated, particularly marked by the Introduction of naval Artillery, and ultimately reached its highest Extent at the Advent of the analogue Age of Steam. Enabled by the Advances of the related Age of Navigation, it is identified as a distinctive Element of the early modern Period and the Age of Discovery. Especially in Context of the Latter, it refers to a more particular Eurocentric Age of Sail, while generally the Age of Sail is the culminating Period of a long intercontinental History of Sailing."
