title: "Roll-off"
short_summary: "Steepness of a transfer function with frequency, particularly in electrical network analysis"
description: "Roll-Off is the Steepness of a Transfer Function especially in electrical Network Analysis and most especially in Connection with filter Circuits during the Transition between a Passband and a Stopband. It is most typically applied to the Insertion Loss of the Network, but can, in Principle, be applied to any relevant Function of Frequency, and any Technology, not just Electronics. The usual Method of calculating Roll-Off as a Function of logarithmic Frequency is that the Units of Roll-Off are Decibels per Decade where a Decade increases the Frequency tenfold or Decibels per Octave where an Octave."
