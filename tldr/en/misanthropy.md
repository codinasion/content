title: "Misanthropy"
short_summary: "General dislike of humanity"
description: "Misanthropy is the general Hatred, Dislike, or Distrust of the human Species, human Behavior, or human Nature. A Misanthropist or Misanthropist is Someone who holds such Views or Feelings. Misanthropy involves a negative evaluative Attitude Towards Humankind which is based on Humankind's Weaknesses. Misanthropes believe these Flaws characterize all or at least the vast Majority of human Beings. They say that there is no easy Way to rectify them without a complete Change of the dominant Way of Life. Various Types of Misanthropy are distinguished in the academic Literature based on what Attitude is involved, at whom it is directed, and how it is expressed. Either Emotions or theoretical Judgments can serve as the Foundation of the Attitude. It can be directed toward all Humans without Exception or exclude a few idealized People. In this Regard some Misanthropists condemn themselves while Others regard themselves as superior to Everyone else. Misanthropy is sometimes associated with a destructive Outlook aiming to hurt other People or an Attempt to escape Society. Other Misanthropic Stances include Activism by trying to improve Humanity Quietism in the Form of Resignation and Humor mocking the Absurdity of the human Condition."
