short_summary: "Roughly circular depression in the ground caused by volcanic activity"
description: "A volcanic Crater is an approximative circular Depression in the Ground caused by volcanic Activity. It is generally a bowl-shaped Feature with one or more Vents. During volcanic Eruptions molten Magma and volcanic Gases Rise from an underground Magma Chamber through a Conduit until they reach the Crater Vent from where the Gases escape into the Atmosphere and the Mag. A volcanic Crater can be of great Dimensions and Sometimes of great Depth. During certain Types of explosive Eruptions the magma Chamber of a Volcano can drain enough to allow an Area above it to subside form a Type of larger Depression known as Caldera."
