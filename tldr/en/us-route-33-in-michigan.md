description: "Us highway 33 is a Part of the numbered Highway System that was once located in berrien County Michigan. At the Time it was removed from the State, it was only about 2. 8 Miles long running north from the Indiana State Line to an Intersection with Us 12 South of Niles. The Highway was not originally Part of the Us Highway System in the State ; it was added in 1938 as a second Designation for Part of Us 31 between the State Line and St. Joseph. It was later extended further north to the Community of Lake Michigan Beach. This Extension became the only Section of the Us33 that was untroubled by another Highway until it was truncated to Niles. In 1997 the us 33 was officially removed from the State."
