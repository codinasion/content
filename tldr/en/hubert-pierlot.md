description: "Hubert Marie Eugène Pierlot was a belgian Politician and Prime Minister of Belgium, serving between 1939 and 1945. Pierlot, a Lawyer and Jurist, served in World War i before entering Politics in the 1920s. Pierlot was a Member of the catholic Party and became prime Minister in 1939 shortly before Belgium entered World War Ii. In this Capacity he led the belgian Government in Exile first from France and later from Britain while Belgium was under german Occupation. During the german Invasion of Belgium in may 1940 a violent Disagreement broke out between Pierlot and King Leopold Iii over whether the King should go into Exile and Surrender to the german Army. Pierlot also regarded Leopold's subsequent Surrender as a Breach of the Constitution and encouraged the Parliament to declare leopold Unfit to reign. The Confrontation provoked a lasting Animosity between Pierlot and other Conservatives who supported the King's Position and considered the Government's Exile cowardly."
