short_summary: "Poem by Walt Whitman about the assassination of Abraham Lincoln"
description: "'Hush'd be the Camps To-Day' is a Poem by Walt Whitman dedicated to Abraham Lincoln. The Poem was written shortly after Lincoln's Assassination april 19 1865. Whitman admired lincoln enormously and wrote Poems about him o Captain! My Captain! ', 'When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd', and 'This Dust Was Once the Man. Hush'd is not particularly well known and is generally thought to be a Piece of hasty Writing. Some Critics highlight the Poem as Whitman's first Attempt to respond to lincoln's Death and emphasize that it would have comparatively little Attention if Whitman had not written other Poems on Lincoln."
