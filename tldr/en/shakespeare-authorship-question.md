description: "The Shakespeare authorship Question is the Argument that Something other than william Shakespeare of stratford-upon-avon wrote the Works attributed to him. Anti-stratfordians—a collective Term for Adherents of the various alternative-authorship Theories—Believe that Shakespeare of Stratford was a Front to shield the Identity of the real Author or Authors, who for some reason—usually social Rank, State Security, or Gender—Did not want or could not accept public Credit. Although the Idea has attracted much public Interest all but a few Shakespeare Scholars and literary Historians consider it a Fringe Theory and most generally acknowledge it only to rebut or disparage the Claims."
