short_summary: "1945 torpedo bomber aircraft prototype series by Curtiss"
description: "The curtiss Xbtc was a prototype Single-Seat single-engined torpedodive Bomber developed for the united States navy during World War Ii. Four Aircraft were ordered powered by two different Engines but the two Aircraft to be fitted with the wright r-3350 radial Engine were cancelled in late 1942 leaving only the Pair with the pratt Whitney r-4360 radial Engine. By this Time Curtiss Aircraft was overwhelmed with Work and the Navy gave the xbtc-2 Prototypes a low Priority which delayed Progress so the first Flight did not take Place until the Beginning. One Aircraft crashed in early 1947 and the other was disposed of Later that Year."
