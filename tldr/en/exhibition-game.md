short_summary: "Sporting event wherein the result has no external impact"
description: "An Exhibition Game is a sporting Event whose Prize Money and Impact on the Player or the Team's Rankings are either zero or otherwise greatly reduced. Exhibition Games often serve as'warm-up Matches' particularly in many Team Sports where these Games help Coaches and Managers select and Condition Players for competitive Matches in a League Season or Tournament. If the Players usually play in different Teams in other Leagues exhibition Games offer Players an Opportunity to learn to work with each other. Games can be held between separate Teams or between Parts of the same Team."
