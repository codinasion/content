short_summary: "Buried stream in Manhattan, New York"
description: "Minetta Creek was one of the largest natural Watercourses in Manhattan, New York City, United States. Minetta Creek was fed by two Tributaries one to fifth Avenue and 21st Street and the other at sixth Avenue and 16th Street. They joined near Fifth Avenue and 11th Street then took a southwesterly course. Minetta Creek's Name is believed to have originated either from the native american Term Manette meaning Devil's Water or the dutch Word Minnetje meaning the tiny One."
