title: "Gleason's theorem"
short_summary: "Theorem in quantum mechanics"
description: "Gleason's Theorem shows that the Rule one uses to calculate Probabilities in Quantum Physics the born Rule can be derived from the usual mathematical Representation of Measurements in Quantum Physics with the Assumption of Non-Contextuality. Andrew M. In 1957 Gleason first proved this Theorem answering a Question by George W. Mackey, an Accomplishment that was historically significant for the Role it played in showing that wide Classes of hidden-variable Theories are inconsistent with quantum Physics. Multiple Variations have been demonstrated in the Years since. Gleason's Theorem is of particular Importance for the Field of quantum Logic and its Attempt to find a minimal Set of mathematical Axioms for Quantum Theory."
