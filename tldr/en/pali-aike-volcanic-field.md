description: "The pali-aike volcanic Field is a volcanic Field along the Border between Argentina and Chile. It is Part of a Family of Back-Arc Volcanoes in Patagonia that formed from Processes including the Collision of Chile Ridge with the Peruchile Trench. It lies farther east than the Austral Volcanic Zone, the volcanic Arc that makes up the Andean Volcanic Belt at this Latitude. Pali-Aike formed over sedimentary rock of Magallanes Basin, a Jurassic-age basin starting from the late Miocene as a consequence of regional tectonic events."
