title: "Raphinae"
short_summary: "Extinct subfamily of birds"
description: "Raphinae are a Clade of extinct Flightless Birds formerly called Didines or Didine Birds. They inhabited the Mascarene Islands of Mauritius and Rodrigues but became extinct in the 17th Century through Hunting by Humans and Predation by introduced non-native Mammals. Historically, many different Groups have been named for both the Dodo and the Rodrigues Solitaire, not all grouping them together. Most recently it is thought that the two Birds can be classified in the Family of Columbidae often under the subfamily Raphinae. The first Person to suggest a close Affinity to Doves was Johannes theodor reinhardt whose Views were then supported by Hugh Edwin Strickland and Alexander Gordon Melville."
