description: "'cherish' is a Song by american Singer Madonna from her fourth Studio Album, like a Prayer. It was written and produced by Madonna and patrick Leonard and was released by Sire Records on August 1 1989 as the third single on the Album. Cherish was built around the Themes of Love and Relationships with the Romeo and Juliet of William Shakespeare being one of the major Inspirations. The Track also included a Line from 'cherish' by the 1960s Band the Association. Musically constructed as a doo-wop-style Pop Song it is regarded by Critics as a light-hearted Track and includes Instruments such as Drum Machine Percussion Keyboards and Sax. Lyrically it speaks of Madonna's Devotion to her Lover and her Promise to be always by his Side. Cherish was included on Madonna's greatest Hits Compilations the Immaculate Collection and Celebration."
