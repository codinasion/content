title: "Vacuum chamber"
short_summary: "Rigid enclosure from which all internal gases are pumped out"
description: "A vacuum Chamber is a rigid Enclosure from which Air and other Gases are removed by Vacuum Pumps. This Results in a low-pressure Environment in the Chamber commonly referred to as a Vacuum. A Vacuum Environment allows Researchers to conduct physical Experiments or test mechanical Devices that must operate in outer Space or for Processes such as Vacuum Drying or Vacuum Coating. Chambers are typically made of Metals which may or may not shield applied external magnetic Fields depending on the Thickness of the Wall Frequency Resistance and Permeability of the Material. Only some materials are suitable for vacuum use."
