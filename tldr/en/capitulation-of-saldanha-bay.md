short_summary: "1796 Dutch to British naval surrender"
description: "The Capitulation of Saldanha Bay was the Surrender of a dutch expeditionary Force sent to capture the dutch Cape Colony in 1796 to the british Royal Navy. In 1794, early in the french Revolutionary Wars, the Army of the french Republic overran the Dutch Republic which then became a french Client State, the Batavian Republic. Britain was concerned about the Threat the dutch Cape Colony in southern Africa posed to its Trade Routes to british India. It therefore sent an expeditionary Force that landed at Simon's Town in June 1795 and in a short Campaign forced the Surrender of the Colony. The british Commander vice-admiral Sir George Elphinstone then reinforced the Garrison and stationed a naval Squadron in the Cape to protect the captured Colony."
