short_summary: "Extinct hominid from South Africa"
description: "Australopithecus africanus is an extinct species of australopithecine which lived between about 3. 3 and 2. 1 million Years ago in the late Pliocene to early Pleistocene of South Africa. The Species has been recovered from Taung Sterkfontein Makapansgat and Gladysvale. The first Specimen, the Taung Child, was described by anatomist Raymond Dart in 1924, and was the first early Hominin found. However its Closer Relationships to Humans than to other Apes would not become widely accepted until the Middle of the Century because most People believed that Humans evolved outside of Africa. It is unclear how A. Africanus Relates to other Hominins, being variously placed as ancestral to Homo and Paranthropus, to just paranthropus, or to just P. robustus. The Specimen 'little Foot' is the most completely preserved early Hominin, with 90 % of the Skeleton intact, and the oldest south african Australopith. However, it is controversially suggested that it and similar specimens be split off into 'A. prometheus'."
