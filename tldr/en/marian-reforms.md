title: "Marian reforms"
short_summary: "Putative reforms of the Roman military in 107 BC"
description: "The marian Reforms were putative Changes to the Composition and Operation of the roman Army during the late Roman Republic generally attributed to gaius Marius. The most important of these putative Changes was the Change in the socio-economic Background of the Soldiery. Other Changes were supposed to include the Introduction of the Cohort the institutional Adoption of a single Form of heavy Infantry with uniform Equipment the universal Adoption of the eagle Standard and the Abolition of the Citizen Cavalry. It was widely believed that Marius changed the socio-economic Background of the Soldiers by allowing Citizens without Property to join the Roman army a Process called Proletarianisation. This Proletarianisation was then supposed to have created a semi-professional Class of Soldiers motivated by Land Grants which became in Turn Customers of their Generals who then used them to overthrow the Republic."
