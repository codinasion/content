description: "Nasa Astronaut Group 2 also known as the next nine and the new nine was the second Group of Astronauts selected by the national Aeronautics and Space Administration. Their Selection was announced on 17 September 1962. The Group augmented the Mercury Seven. President John F. On may 25 1961 Kennedy announced Project Apollo with the ambitious Goal of putting a Man on the Moon by the End of the Decade and more Astronauts were required to fly the two-man Gemini Spacecraft and three-man Apollo Spacecraft that were then under Development. The Mercury seven had been selected to accomplish the Simpler Task of orbital Flight but the new Challenges of Space rendezvous and lunar Landing led to the Selection of Candidates with advanced Engineering Degrees as well as Test Pilot Experience."
