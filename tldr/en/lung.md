short_summary: "Primary organ of the respiratory system"
description: "The Lungs are the most important Organs of the Respiratory System in Humans and most other Animals including some Snails and a small Number of fish. In Mammals and most other Vertebrates two Lungs are located near the Backbone on either Side of the Heart. Their Function in the Respiratory System is to extract Oxygen from the Air and transfer it into the Bloodstream and Release Carbon Dioxide from the Bloodstream in a Gas Exchange Process into the Atmosphere. The thin Smooth and Moist Pleurae serve to reduce Friction between the Lungs and the chest Wall during breathing allowing for easy and effortless Movements of the Lungs."
