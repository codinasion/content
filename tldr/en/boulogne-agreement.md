short_summary: "14th century proclamation on the rights of the Crown and the king's honor"
description: "The Boulogne Agreement was a Document signed in 1308 by a Group of english Magnates concerning edward Ii's Government. Soon after the Death of Edward I in 1307 Discontent developed against the new King. This was partly due to the lingering Problems of the previous Reign but also related to Issues with edward Ii himself. Particularly his Abandonment of the scottish Wars and his Patronage of the unpopular Piers gaveston caused a little Discontent. Drawn up during the Nuptials of the King in Boulogne-Sur-Mer the Document vaguely asserted the Signatories' Duty to guard the Crown Rights. Three Months later the Agreement was the Basis of another Document justifying Opposition to the King. This latter Document, the so-called Declaration of 1308, is notable for its Use of the 'Doctrine of Capacities': the Distinction between the Person of the King and the Institution of the Crown."
