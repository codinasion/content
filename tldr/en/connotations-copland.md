description: "Connotations is a classical Music Composition for the symphonic Orchestra written by the american Composer Aaron Copland. Commissioned in 1962 by leonard Bernstein to commemorate the Opening of the philharmonic Hall in new York City united States this Piece marks a Departure from Copland's Populist Period which began with el Saln Mxico in 1936 and includes Works he is most famous for such as. It represents a Return to a more dissonant Style of Composition in which copland wrote from the End of his Studies with the french Pedagogue Nadia Boulanger and was returned from Europe in 1924 until the great Depression. It was also Copland's first dodecaphonic Work for Orchestra which he disregarded until he heard the Music of french Composer Pierre Boulez and adapted the Method for himself in his Piano Quartet of 1950. While the Composer had produced other contemporary orchestral Works to Connotations it was his first purely symphonic Work since his third symphonic."
