title: "Sound and language in Middle-earth"
short_summary: "Tolkien's theory of language"
description: "J. R. R. Tolkien was both a Philologist and an Author of the high Fantasy. He had a private Theory that the Sound of Words was directly connected to their Meaning and that certain Sounds are inherently beautiful. Scholars believe he intentionally chosen Words and Names in his constructed middle-earth Languages to create Feelings such as Beauty Longing and Strangeness. Tolkien said he wrote his Stories in Order to provide a Setting for his Languages rather than the other Way around. Tolkien constructed Languages for the Elves to sound pleasant, and the Black Speech of the evil Land of Mordor to sound harsh ; Poetry suitable for various Peoples of his invented World of Middle-Earth ; and many Place-Names, chosen to convey the Nature of each Region. The Theory is individual, but it was in the Context of literary and artistic Movements such as Vorticism, and earlier nonsense Verse that stressed Language and the Sound of Words, even when the Words were apparently nonsense."
