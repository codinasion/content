short_summary: "Mechanisms and evolution of insect flight"
description: "Insects are the only Group of Invertebrates that have evolved Wings and Flight. Insects first flew in the Carboniferous, some 300 to 350 million Years ago, making them the first Animals to evolve Flight. Wings could have evolved from Appendages on the Sides of existing Limbs which had Nerves Joints and Muscles used for other Purposes. These may have initially been used for sailing on Water or to slow the Descent Rate when Gliding."
