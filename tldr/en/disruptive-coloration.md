title: "Disruptive coloration"
short_summary: "Camouflage to break up an object's outlines"
description: "Disruptive Coloration is a Form of Camouflage that works by breaking up the Lines of an animal Soldier or military Vehicle with a strongly contrasting Pattern. It is often combined with other Methods of Crypsis including background Colour Matching and Countershading ; special Cases are coincident disruptive Coloration and the disruptive Eye Mask seen in some Fishes, Amphibians, and Reptiles. It appears paradoxical as a Way of not being seen, since Disruption of Outlines Depends on high Contrast, so the Patches of Colour are themselves conspicuous."
