short_summary: "Overview of the architecture of Scotland"
description: "The architecture of Scotland includes all human building within the modern borders of Scotland, from the Neolithic era to the present day. The earliest Surviving Houses go back around 9500 Years, and the first Villages 6000 Years: Skara Brae on the Mainland of Orkney being the earliest preserved Example in Europe. Crannogs, Roundhouses, each built on an artificial Island, Date from the Bronze Age and Stone Buildings called Atlantic Roundhouses and larger Earthwork Hill Forts from the Iron Age. The Arrival of the Romans from 71 Ad led to the Creation of Forts like the one at Trimontium and a continuous Fortification between the Firth of Forth and the Firth of Clyde known as the Antonine Wall in the second. Beyond roman Influence there is Evidence of Wheelhouses and underground Souterrains. After the Departure of the Romans there were a Series of nucleated Forts often using major geographical Features such as Dunadd and Dunbarton."
