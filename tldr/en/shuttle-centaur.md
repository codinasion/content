title: "Shuttle-Centaur"
short_summary: "Proposed Space Shuttle upper stage"
description: "Shuttle-Centaur was a Version of the upper Stage Rocket Centaur designed to be carried aloft inside the Space Shuttle and used to launch Satellites into high Earth Orbits or Probes. Two Variants were developed: Centaur G-Prime, which was planned to launch the Galileo and Ulysses robotic Probes to Jupiter, and Centaur G, a shortened Version planned for Use with United States Department of Defense Milstar Satellites and the Magellan Venus Probe. The powerful Centaur upper Stage allowed for heavier deep Space Probes, and for them to reach Jupiter Sooner, prolonging the operational Life of the Spacecraft. But neither variant ever ran on the Shuttle. The Project was supported by the united States Air Force and national Reconnaissance Office which asserted that its classified Satellites required the Power of Centaur. The usaf agreed to pay half the Cost of the Design and Development of Centaur G and the national Aeronautics and Space Administration paid the other Half."
