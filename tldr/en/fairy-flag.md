description: "The Fairy Flag is an heirloom of the chiefs of Clan MacLeod. It is held in Dunvegan Castle along with other notable Heirlooms, such as the Dunvegan Cup and Sir Rory Mor's Horn. The Fairy Flag is known for the many celtic Fairies Traditions and the associated magical Properties. The Flag is made of Silk, is yellow or brown in Colour, and is a Square of Side about 18 Inches. It has been examined numerous Times in the last two Centuries and its Condition has slightly deteriorated. It is ripped and tattered, and is considered to be extremely fragile. The flag is covered in small red 'elf dots'. In the early Part of the 19th Century the Flag was also marked with small Crosses but these have since disappeared. The Silk of the Flag has been said to have originated in the far east and was therefore extremely valuable which led some to believe that the Flag may have been of some Sort of significant Relic. Others have attempted to associate the Flag with the Crusades or even with a Raven Banner which was said to have been used by various viking Leaders in the british Isles."
