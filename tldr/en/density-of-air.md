title: "Density of air"
short_summary: "Mass per unit volume of the Earth's atmosphere"
description: "The Density of Air or atmospheric Density defined is the Mass of the Earth's atmosphere per Unit Volume. Air Density, like Air Pressure, decreases with increasing Altitude. It also changes with Variations in atmospheric Pressure, Temperature and Humidity. At 101. 325 Kpa and 20 °C, Air has a Density of approximately 1. 204 Kg/M3, according to the International Standard Atmosphere. At 101. 325 Kpa and 15 °C, Air has a Density of approximately 1. 225 Kg/M3, which is about 1⁄800 that of Water, according to the International Standard Atmosphere. Pure liquid Water is 1,000 Kg/M3."
