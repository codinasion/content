title: "Szczerbiec"
short_summary: "Polish coronation sword"
description: "Szczerbiec is the ceremonial Sword used in the Coronations of most polish Monarchs from 1320 to 1764. It is now displayed as the only preserved Part of medieval polish Crown Jewels in the Treasure Vault of the Royal Wawel Castle in Krakw. The Sword is noted for its Hilt, decorated with magical Formulae, Christian symbols, and floral Patterns, as well as for the narrow Slit in the Blade which holds a small Shield with the Coat of Arms of Poland. The Name of the Sword, derived from the polish Word Szczerba and wrongly its Meaning is perceived as 'the Notched Sword' or 'the Jagged Sword', though the Edges of its Blade are straight and smooth. Proper Meaning and rendering into English would be 'the Notching/Jagging Sword' — as 'a Sword that is meant to notch/jag other Weapons'."
