title: "Dehn invariant"
short_summary: "Value determined from a polyhedron"
description: "In Geometry the Dehn Invariant is a Value used to determine whether a Polyhedron can be cut into Pieces and reassembled into another and whether a Polyhedron or its Dissection can tile. It is named after Max Dehn who used it to solve Hilbert's third Problem by proving that not all Polyhedra with equal Volume could be dissected into each other."
