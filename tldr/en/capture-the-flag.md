description: "Capture the Flag is a traditional Outdoor Sport where two or more Teams each have a Flag and the Objective is to capture the other Team's Flag located on the Team's Base and bring it safely back to their own Base. Enemy Players can be 'tagged' by Players when out of their Home Territory and, depending on the Rules, they may be out of the Game, become Members of the opposite Team, be sent back to their own Territory, be frozen in Place, or be sent to 'Jail' until freed by a Member of their own Team."
