The Album benefited from two Band Members installing Studios at Home, which allowed them to develop more sophisticated Songs and Arrangements and expand their musical Style. Several Songs subsequently became Fixtures in the Group's live Set, including 'the Song remains the Same', 'the Rain Song' and 'no Quarter'. Other Material recorded at the Sessions including the Title Track was shelved and released on later albums physical Graffiti and Coda. All Instruments and Vocals were provided by the Band Members Robert Plant, Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones, and John Bonham. The Album was produced by Page and was mixed by eddie Kramer. The Cover was the first for the Band to be designed by Hipgnosis and was based on a Photograph taken at Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland."
