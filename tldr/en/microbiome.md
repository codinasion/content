title: "Microbiome"
short_summary: "Microbial community assemblage and activity"
description: "A Microbiome is a Community of Microorganisms usually found in any given Habitat that live together. It was more precisely defined by whipps Et Al in 1988. as 'a characteristic microbial community occupying a reasonably well-defined habitat which has distinct physio-chemical properties. The Term Refers thus not only to the Microorganisms involved but also to their Activity. In 2020 an international Panel of Experts published the Results of their Discussions on the Definition of the Microbiome. They proposed a Definition of the Microbiome based on a Revival of the compact clear and comprehensive Description of the Term originally provided by whipps Et al. , but supplemented with two explanatory paragraphs. The first explanatory Paragraph pronounces the dynamic Character of the Microbiome and the second Explanatory Paragraph clearly separates the Term Microbiota from the Term Microbiome."
