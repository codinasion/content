description: "Wulfred was an Anglo-Saxon Archbishop of Canterbury in medieval England. Nothing is known about his Life until 803 when he attended a Church Council but he was probably a Nobleman from Middlesex. He was elected an Archbishop in 805 and spent his Time reforming the Clergy of his Cathedral. He also argued with two consecutive mercian Kings Coenwulf and Ceolwulf whether Laymen or Clergy should control Monasteries. At one Point wulfred went to rome to consult the Papacy and was deposed for several Years over the Issue. After Coenwulf's Death Relations with the new King Ceolwulf were somewhat better but improved much more after Ceolwulf's subsequent Deposition. The Dispute about the Control of the Monasteries was not fully resolved until 838 after wulfred's Death. Wulfred was the first Archbishop to put his Portrait on the Coinage he struck."
