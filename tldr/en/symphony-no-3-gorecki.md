description: "The Symphony No. 3, Op. 36 also known as the Symphony of sorrowful Songs is a Symphony composed between October and december 1976 by Henryk Grecki in Katowice Poland. The Work is indicative of the Transition between Górecki's earlier dissonant Style and his later more tonal Style and 'represented a stylistic Breakthrough: austerely plaintive, emotionally direct and steeped in Medieval Modes'. It was premièred on 4 April 1977, at the Royan International Festival, with Stefania Woytowicz as Soprano and Ernest Bour as Conductor."
