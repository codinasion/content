short_summary: "Bowed, fretted and stringed instrument"
description: "The Viol Viola Da Gamba or informally gamba is any of a Family of bowed fretted and stringed Instruments with hollow wooden Bodies and Pegboxes where the Tension on the Strings can be increased or decreased to adjust the Pitch. Frets on the Viol are usually made of Gut that are glued on the Fingerboard around the Neck of the Instrument to enable the Performer to stop the Strings cleanly. Frets improve the Consistency of Intonation and lend the stopped Notes a Tone that better matches the open Strings. Viols first appeared in Spain and Italy in the mid-late 15th Century and were most popular in the Renaissance and Baroque Period. Early Ancestors include the arabic Rebab and the medieval european Vielle but later more direct possible Ancestors include the venetian Viole and the 15th and 16th-century spanish Vihuela a six-course plucked Instrument tuned like a Lute."
