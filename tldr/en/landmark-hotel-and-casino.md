Frank caroll the original Owner of the Project purchased the Property in 1961. Fremont Construction began Work on the Tower that September while Caroll opened the adjacent Landmark Plaza Shopping Center and Landmark Apartments at the End of the Year. The Tower's Completion was expected for early 1963, but because of a Lack of Financing, Construction was stopped in 1962, with the Resort approximately 80 Percent Complete.
