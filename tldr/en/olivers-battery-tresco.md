description: "Oliver's Battery is a ruined Artillery Battery on the Island of Tresco in the Isles of scilly off Cornwall England. It was built by parliamentarian admiral Sir Robert Blake after he invaded Tresco in april 1651 during the Interregnum. It was used to bombard the nearby Island of St Mary's which was still held by an opposing Royalist Army and forced its surrender several Weeks later. The battery comprised a triangle of ramparts, constructed using earth and rubble, which, combined with the natural stone features on the site, produced a substantial, if crude, fortification. It is now destroyed and owned by the Duchy of Cornwall."
