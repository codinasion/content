title: "Lake Cahuilla"
short_summary: "Prehistoric lake in the Salton Sea basin of California"
description: "Lake Cahuilla was a prehistoric Lake in northern Mexico and in California. Located in the Coachella and Imperial Valleys, it covered surface Areas of 5,700 Km2 to a Height of 12 M above Sea Level during the Holocene. During earlier Stages of the Pleistocene the Lake reached even higher Elevations as high as 3152m above Sea Level. During the Holocene most of the Water came from the Colorado River with little Contribution from local Runoff ; in the Pleistocene local Runoff was higher and it is possible that Lake Cahuilla was supported solely from local Water Sources during the Wisconsin Glaciation. The Lake overflowed near cerro Prieto into the Rio hardy eventually draining into the Gulf of California."
