short_summary: "1994 single by Madonna"
description: "'secret' is a Song by american Singer Madonna from her sixth Studio Album, Bedtime Stories. It was released as the Lead single from the Album by Maverick Records on September 26 1994. The Singer originally recorded the Song as a Demo with Producer Shep Pettibone. However, Dallas Austin replaced Pettibone's Role as the Producer and reworked its Composition, earning him a writing Credit alongside Madonna. It was a Departure from Madonna's previous musical Style, since up to that Point in her Career, her Music had mostly consisted of big-sounding Dance Tracks and melodic Ballads. 'secret' combined the Pop and R & B genres with Instrumentation from an acoustic Guitar, Drums and Strings, while lyrically talking about a Lover having a secret."
