short_summary: "Electronic device/component that increases the strength of a signal"
description: "An amplifier electrical Amplifier or Amp is an electronic Device that can increase the Magnitude of a Signal. It is a two-port electronic Circuit that uses electric Power from a Power Supply to increase the Amplitude of a signal applied to its Input Terminals producing a proportionally higher amplitude Signal at the. The Amount of Amplification provided by an Amplifier is measured by its Gain the Ratio of Output current or Power to input. An Amplifier is defined as a Circuit having a Power Gain greater than one."
