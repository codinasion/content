description: "In reformed Theology Baptism is a Sacrament that signifies the baptized Person's Union with Christ or becoming Part of Christ and being treated as if he had done Everything Christ. Sacraments along with the Preaching of God's Word are Means of Grace through which God offers Christ to his Elect. Sacraments are believed to have their Effect through the holy Spirit but these Effects are only believed to accrue to those who are predestined to have faith in Christ."
