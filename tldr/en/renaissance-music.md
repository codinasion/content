title: "Renaissance music"
short_summary: "Western musical period between the 15th and 17th centuries"
description: "Renaissance Music is traditionally understood to cover european Music of the 15th and 16th Centuries later than the Renaissance Era as it is understood in other Disciplines. Rather than starting from the early 14th-century Ars nova, the Trecento Music was treated by Musicology as a Coda to Medieval Music and the new Era dated from the Rise of triadic Harmony and the Spread of the Contenance Angloise Style from Britain to the burgundian School. A Convenient watershed for its End is the Adoption of the Basso Continuo at the Start of the Baroque Period."
