short_summary: "2017 studio album by Com Truise"
description: "Iteration is the second Studio Album by American electronic musician Seth Haley as Com Truise, released on June 16, 2017, by Ghostly International. It is the last in his Series of Albums about the Story of a fictional Astronaut named Com Truise. This Part of the Story involves truise escaping from his alien Lover from the Planet wave 1 to live together in Space. Iteration is the Project's first Studio Album since in Decay. Haley went to record in Burbank, California, an Area with a very 'open Space', in Order to get excited into the Material he was making. The Space is reflected in the Sound and Production of the Music, which is less compressed and more simple than Haley's previous Com Truise Albums."
