short_summary: "Distinctive layered units of iron-rich sedimentary rock that are almost always of Precambrian age"
description: "Banded Iron Formations are distinct Units of sedimentary Rock Consisting of alternating Layers of Iron Oxides and iron-poor Chert. They can be up to several hundred Meters thick and extend laterally for several hundred Kilometers. Almost all of these Formations are precambrian and were thought to measure the Oxygenation of the Earth's Oceans. Some of Earth's oldest Rock Formations formed about 3700million Years ago are associated with banded Iron Formations."
