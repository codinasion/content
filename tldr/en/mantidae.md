title: "Mantidae"
short_summary: "Family of praying mantises"
description: "Mantidae is one of the largest Families in the Order of praying Mantises based on the Type Species mantis religiosa although most Genera are tropical or subtropical. Historically, this was the only Family in the Order, and many References still use the Term 'Mantid' to refer to any Mantis. Technically, however, 'Mantid' Refers only to Members of the Family Mantidae, and not the 14 remaining Families of Mantises. Some of the most recent Classifications have promoted a Number of the Mantid Subfamilies to the Rank of Family E. G. Iridopterygidae, Sibyllidae, Tarachodidae, Thespidae, and Toxoderidae, while other Classifications have reduced the Number of Subfamilies without elevating to higher Rank."
