description: "Caesium is a Chemical Element which has the Symbol Cs and the atomic Number 55. It is a soft, silvery-golden alkali metal with a melting point of 28. 5 °C, which makes it one of only five elemental Metals that are liquid at or near Room Temperature. Caesium has physical and chemical properties similar to those of rubidium and potassium. It is pyrophoric and Reacts with Water even at −116 °C. It is the least electronegative element, with a value of 0. 79 on the Pauling Scale. It has only one stable Isotope Caesium 133. Caesium is most commonly mined in Pollucite. Caesium 137 a Fission Product is extracted from Waste created by nuclear Reactors. It has the largest atomic Radius of all Elements whose Radii have been measured or calculated at about 260 Picometers."
