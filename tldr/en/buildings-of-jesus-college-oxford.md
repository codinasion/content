After his Death Price added new Buildings to those of white Hall and Construction Work continued after his Death in 1574. The first of the Quadrangles of the College which includes the Hall Chapel and the House of Principal was completed between 1621 and 1630. Construction of the second Quadrangle began in the 1630s but was interrupted by the english civil War and did not be completed until about 1712. Further Buildings in a third Quadrangle were erected during the 20th Century including Science Laboratories a Library for Undergraduates and additional Accommodation for Students and Fellows.
