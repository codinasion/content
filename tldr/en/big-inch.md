short_summary: "Petroleum pipelines from Texas to New Jersey"
description: "The big Inch and little big Inch Pipelines collectively known as the Inch Pipelines are petroleum Pipelines extending from Texas to new Jersey built in the united States between 1942 and 1944 as Emergency War Measures. S. Petroleum Products were transported by Ship by Tankers from Texas' Oil Fields into the north-eastern States before World War Ii. This critical Link was attacked by german Submarines in Operation Paukenschlag after the united States entered the War on january 1 1942 threatening both the Oil Supplies to the north-east and its onward Transshipment to great Britain. The Interior Secretary harold Ickes championed the Project as a Way of transporting Petroleum by the more secure interior Route."
