title: "Magnetostatics"
short_summary: "Branch of physics about magnetism in systems with steady electric currents"
description: "Magnetostatics is the Study of magnetic Fields in Systems where Currents are steady. It is the magnetic Analog of Electrostatics where the Charges are stationary. The Magnetization need not be static Equations can be used in Magnetostatics to predict fast magnetic switching Events that occur on Time Scales of Nanoseconds or less. Magnetostatics is even a good Approximation when the Currents are not static as long as the Currents do not alternate rapidly. Magnetostatics is widely used in Applications of Micromagnetics such as Models of magnetic Storage Devices as Computer Memory."
