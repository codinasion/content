short_summary: "National anthem of Lithuania"
description: "'tautiška Giesmė' is the national Anthem of Lithuania, also known by its Opening Words, 'Lietuva, Tėvyne Mūsų', and as 'Lietuvos Himnas'. The Music and the Lyrics were written by Vincas Kudirka in 1898 when Lithuania was still Part of the russian Empire. The fifty-word poem was a condensation of Kudirka's conceptions of the Lithuanian state, the Lithuanian people, and their past. Shortly before his death in 1899, the anthem was performed for Lithuanians living in Saint Petersburg, Russia."
