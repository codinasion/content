short_summary: "Third-largest asteroid"
description: "Pallas is the second Asteroid discovered after Ceres. Like Ceres it is believed to have a mineral Composition similar to carbonaceous Chondrite Meteorites though significantly less hydrated than Ceres. It is the third-largest Asteroid in the solar System by both Volume and Mass and is likely a remnant Protoplanet. It is 79 % the Mass of Vesta and 22 % the Mass of Ceres, constituting an estimated 7 % of the Mass of the asteroid Belt. Its estimated Volume is equivalent to a sphere 507 to 515 Kilometers in Diameter, 90â€“95 % the Volume of Vesta."
