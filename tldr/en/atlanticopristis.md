description: "Atlanticopristis is an extinct genus of sclerorhynchid that lived during the Middle Cretaceous of what is now the Northeast Region of Brazil, between 100. 5 and 93. 9 million years ago. Fourteen fossil Teeth from Atlanticopristis were found in the Alc√¢ntara Formation, and referred to the closely related Onchopristis in 2007 ; a Redescription in 2008 by brazilian Paleontologists Manuel Medeiros and Agostinha Pereira assigned it to a new Genus containing one Species, Atlanticopristis Equatorialis."
