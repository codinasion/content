short_summary: "1864–1865 war between Brazil and Uruguay"
description: "The uruguayan War was fought between Uruguay's governing Blanco Party and an Alliance comprised of the Empire of Brazil and the uruguayan Colorado Party covertly supported by Argentina. Since its Independence Uruguay had been ravaged by intermittent Conflicts between the Blanco and colorado Factions each attempting to take the Position and Maintain Power individually. The Colorado Leader Venancio Flores launched the Liberating Crusade in 1863, an Insurrection aimed at toppling Bernardo Berro, who presided over a Colorado–Blanco Coalition Government. Flores was aided by Argentina, whose President Bartolomé Mitre provided him with Supplies, Argentine Volunteers and River Transport for Troops."
