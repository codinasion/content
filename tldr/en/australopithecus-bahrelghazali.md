description: "Australopithecus Bahrelghazali is an extinct Species of Australopithecine discovered in 1995 at Koro Toro, Bahr el Gazel, Chad, existing around 3. 5 million years ago in the Pliocene. It is the first and only Australopithecine known from central Africa and demonstrates that this Group was distributed throughout Africa as opposed to being restricted as previously thought to east and southern Africa. The Validity of A. Bahrelghazali has not been widely accepted, in Favour of classifying the Specimens as a. afarensis, a better known Pliocene australopithecine from East Africa, because of the anatomical similarity and the fact that A. Bahrelghazali is only known from 3 partial Jawbones and an isolated Premolar. The Specimens inhabited a lakeside Grassland Environment with sparse Tree Cover, possibly similar to the modern Okavango Delta, and similarly predominantly ate C4 Savanna foods—such as Grasses, Sedges, Storage Organs, or rhizomes—and to a lesser Degree also C3 forest foods—such as Fruits, Flowers, Pods, or Insects. However, the Teeth seem ill-equipped to process C4 Plants, so its true Diet is unclear."
