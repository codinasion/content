description: "Joust 2 Survival of the fittest is an arcade Game developed by Williams Electronics and released in 1986. It is a Sequel to williams' 1982 Game Joust. Like its Predecessor, Joust 2 is a 2d aerial Combat Game with Platforms to land on. The Player uses a Button and Joystick to control a Knight riding an Ostrich. The Goal is to progress through Levels by defeating Groups of enemy Knights riding Buzzards. Joust 2 Features improved Audio-Visuals and new Features such as mutant Buzzards created by Eggs falling into Lava, the Ability to transform from an Ostrich to a flying Horse, and differently themed Levels. Waves no longer seamlessly flow into each other ; the Gameplay is divided into separate Screens with Transitions between them."
