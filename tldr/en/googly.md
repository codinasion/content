short_summary: "Delivery in cricket"
description: "In the game of cricket, a googly refers to a type of delivery bowled by a right-arm leg spin bowler. It is different from the normal delivery for a leg-spin bowler in that it is turning the other way. The Googly is not a Variation of the typical off spin Type of Delivery in that the Cricket Ball is presented from the Bowler's Hand in such a Way that once the Ball pitches it deviates in the opposite Direction of a Leg spinning Type of Delivery. It has also been colloquially referred to as the Wrong'Un, Bosie or Bosey, with the latter two eponyms referring to Bernard Bosanquet, the Bowler who originally devised and began using the Googly."
