short_summary: "Aspect of World War II"
description: "British Logistics supported the anglo-canadian 21st Army Group Operations during the siegfried Line Campaign in World War Ii which ran from the End of the Pursuit of german Armies from normandy in mid-september 1944 until the End of January. Operation overlord the allied Landings in normandy began on June 6 1944. The german Resistance was stubborn and the british and canadian Advance was much slower than planned until the german Defences were finally breached in July. What followed was a much more rapid Advance than expected. The british second Army liberated Brussels on September 3 but the subsequent Effort to cross the Rhine with the Aid of airborne Forces in Operation Market Garden was unsuccessful. The canadian first Army had the Task of clearing the Channel Coast. Although the Port of Antwerp had been captured virtually intact on 4 September major Operations were required to clear the german Defenders from the Scheldt estuary and it was not opened for the Shipping until 26 November. Antwerp had enough Capacity to support both british and american Forces but its Use was hampered by german V-Weapon Attacks."
