short_summary: "Civil engineering technique"
description: "A Slurry Wall is a civil Engineering Technique used to build reinforced Concrete Walls in soft Earth Areas close to open Water or with a high Groundwater Table. This Technique is usually used to build diaphragm Walls around Tunnels and open Cuts and to lay Foundations. Slurry Walls are used at Superfund Sites often with other Waste Treatment Methods to contain Waste or Contamination and reduce potential Future Migration of Waste Constituents. Slurry Walls are a well-established Technology but the Decision to use Slurry Walls for a certain Project requires geophysical and other Engineering Studies to develop a Plan appropriate for the Needs of that specific Location. Slurry Walls may need to be used in Conjunction with other Methods to meet the Project Objectives."
