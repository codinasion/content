short_summary: "Imperial Russian Navy's Fidonisy-class destroyer"
description: "Gadzhibey was one of eight Destroyers built in the Class Fidonisy during World War I. Finished in late 1917 too late to see active Service during the War Gadzhibey's Sailors joined the Bolsheviks after the October Revolution. In early 1918, the destroyer assisted in the consolidation of Soviet control over Crimea, fighting against Crimean Tatar forces at Yalta and Alushta. After the german-ukrainian Invasion of Crimea she was withdrawn to Novorossiysk and was scuttled there in June to avoid Capture by german Forces. Raised by the Soviet Union in the late 1920s, Gadzhibey was deemed uneconomical to repair and scrapped. Her Propulsion Equipment was used to refit a Sister Ship."
