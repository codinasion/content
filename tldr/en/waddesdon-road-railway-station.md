description: "Waddesdon Road Railway Station, called Waddesdon Railway Station before 1922, was a small Halt in open Countryside in Buckinghamshire, England. It was opened in 1871 as part of a short horse-drawn tramway to assist with the transport of goods from and around the Duke of Buckingham's extensive estates in Buckinghamshire and to connect the Duke's estates to the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway at Quainton Road. The Line was expanded and converted to Passenger Use in 1872 becoming known as Brill Tramway. The Operation of the Line was taken over by the london-based metropolitan Railway in 1899."
