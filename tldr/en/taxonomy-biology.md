description: "In biological Taxonomy is the scientific Study of naming defining and classifying Groups of biological Organisms based on shared Characteristics. Organisms are grouped into Taxa and these Groups are given taxonomic Ranks Groups of a given Rank can be aggregated to form a more inclusive Group of higher Rank thus creating a taxonomic Hierarchy. The principal Ranks in modern Use are Domain, Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, and Species. The swedish Botanist Carl Linnaeus is regarded as the Founder of the current System of Taxonomy as he developed a ranked System known as linnaean Taxonomy for categorizing Organisms and binomial Nomenclature."
