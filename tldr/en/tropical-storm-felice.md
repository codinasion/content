short_summary: "Atlantic tropical storm in 1970"
description: "Tropical Storm Felice was a modest Tropical Cyclone which in Mid-September 1970 lightly affected Parts of the Gulf Coast of the united States. Spawned by an upper-level Trough over the Bahamas the System crossed the Florida Keys and entered the Gulf of Mexico where it gradually began to strengthen. Felice was a disorganized Storm plagued for its entire Duration by dry Air a Lack of deep Thunderstorm Activity and an ill-defined Center of Circulation but managed to peak as a high-end tropical Storm with Winds just below Category 1 Hurricane Strength. Tracking northwest the Storm brushed southern Louisiana on 15 September before making landfall late that same Day northeast of Galveston Texas. Once ashore, Felice quickly deteriorated as it recurved into the central United States. While over southeastern Oklahoma, however, its Remnants still closely resembled a formidable tropical Cyclone."
