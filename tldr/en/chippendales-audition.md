short_summary: "Saturday Night Live sketch"
description: "Chippendales Audition is a Comedy Sketch which aired on october 27 1990 in the 16th Season of saturday Night live. It stars chris Farley and patrick Swayze as Dancers auditioning for the Male Burlesque Troupe Chippendales. The Sketch's Humor largely stems from the Incongruity of Farley's overweight performing energetic and erotic Dance Moves with his Body that the Judges later described as Fat and Flabby Contrasting with the trim muscular Body of Swayze. More Absurdity is raised as the Panel judging the Men repeatedly concludes that they are closely matched."
