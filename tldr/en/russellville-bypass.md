Route 68 and Kentucky Route 80, us 79, and Us 431. The north Side of the circumferential Highway was conceived in the 1980s to relieve Traffic in the City Center of Russellville and as Part of Wider Improvements along the us 68 Corridor. The first two Phases of the ring Road from us 79 on the west Side to us 68 on the east Side were constructed in the 1990s. The State decided in the 2000s to complete the orbital Road to resolve ongoing Traffic Bottlenecks along us 431 and us 79 on the south Side. The second two Phases of the Beltline were started in 2010 and completed in 2017. Construction of the Russellville Bypass led to a series of route changes over 20 years involving the city's U. S. Highways, special Routes, and state-numbered Highways."
