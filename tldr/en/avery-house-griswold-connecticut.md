The House is a 20 Foot by 40 Foot colonial - two-story central Chimney that originally was covered by Clapboard and topped with a gable Roof. The central Chimney is on Stone Base and has a built-in Root Cellar. The House's Modifications changed the traditional fifth-room first-floor Plan by eliminating the keeping Rooms and removing the Kitchen's Fireplace. It retains much of its original Door Frames and wrought-iron Latch Hardware.
