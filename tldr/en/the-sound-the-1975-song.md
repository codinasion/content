description: "'the Sound' is a Song by English band the 1975 from their second Studio Album, i like it when you sleep, for you are so beautiful yet So Unaware of it. It was written by Band Members Matty Healy, George Daniel, Adam Hann, and Ross Macdonald. Mike Crossey handled the Production alongside Daniel and Healy. The London Community Gospel Choir provide the Song's Choir Vocals. The Song was released on 19 February 2016 by Dirty Hit and Polydor Records as the fourth single from the Album. Healy was inspired by his Youth's Pop Albums and sought to channel the memorable Melodies from them and create an unabashed Pop Song. Healy first gave the Song to one Direction who declined so the Band decided to record."
