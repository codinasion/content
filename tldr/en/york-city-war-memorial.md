short_summary: "Grade II* listed memorial in York, England"
description: "The York City War Memorial is a ww1 Memorial designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and located in York in the North of England. In 1919 Proposals for commemorating the War dead were formulated but proved controversial. Initial Discussions focused on whether a Memorial should be a Monument or should have some utilitarian Purpose. Several functional Proposals were studied until a public Meeting in january 1920 opted for a Monument. The City Engineer produced a Cost Estimate and the War memorial Committee engaged Lutyens who had been recently commissioned by the north eastern Railway to design their own War Memorial in York."
