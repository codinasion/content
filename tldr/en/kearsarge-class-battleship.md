description: "The Kearsarge-Class was a Group of two Battleships built for the united States navy in the 1890s. The two Ships usskearsarge and usskentucky represented a Compromise between two previous Battleship designs the low-freeboard Indiana Class and the high-freeboard ussiowa though their Design also incorporated several Improvements. Their primary Advances over earlier Designs included new quick-fire Guns and improved Armor Protection but their most novel Feature was their two-story Gun Turrets which consisted of a secondary 8-inch Gun Turret fixed to the Top of their primary 13-inch Turrets. The Ships however suffered from a Number of Problems including a tertiary Battery mounted too low in the Hull and poorly-designed Turrets although the Latter was attempted again with the Virginia Class in the early 1900s also with negative Results."
