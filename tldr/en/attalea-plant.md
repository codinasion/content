short_summary: "Genus of palms"
description: "Attalea is a large Genus of Palms native to Mexico, the Caribbean, Central and South America. This pinnately leafed non-spiny Genus includes both small Palms lacking an Aboveground Stem and large Trees. The Genus has a complicated taxonomic History and has often been divided into four or five Genera based on Differences in the Male Flower. Since the Genera can only be distinguished by their Male Flowers the Existence of intermediate Flower Types and the Existence of Hybrids between different Genera have been used as an Argument for keeping them all in the same Genus. This has been supported by recent molecular Phylogenies."
