short_summary: "1713 book on probability and combinatorics by Jacob Bernoulli"
description: "Ars conjectandi is a Book on Combinatorics and mathematical Probability written by Jacob Bernoulli and published eight Years after his Death by his nephew Niklaus Bernoulli. The seminal Work consolidated, apart from many combinatorial Topics, many central Ideas in Probability Theory, such as the very first Version of the Law of large Numbers: indeed, it is widely regarded as the founding Work of that Subject. It also addressed Problems that Today are classified in the twelvefold Way and added to the Subjects ; consequently, it has been dubbed an important historical Landmark in not only Probability but all Combinatorics by a Plethora of mathematical Historians. The Importance of this early Work had a large Impact on both contemporary and later Mathematicians such as Abraham de moivre."
