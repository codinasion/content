description: "The jewish Immigration to puerto Rico began in the 15th Century with the Arrival of the Anusim who accompanied christopher Columbus on his second Voyage. An open Jewish Community in the Colony did not flourish because Judaism was prohibited by the spanish Inquisition. Many however migrated to mountainous Parts of the Island away from the central Power of san Juan and continued to self-identify as Jews and Practice Crypto-Judaism."
