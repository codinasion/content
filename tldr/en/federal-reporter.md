short_summary: "Case law reporting in US courts"
description: "The federal Reporter is a Case Law Reporter in the united States published by west Publishing and Part of the national Reporter System. It begins with Cases decided in 1880 ; pre-1880 Cases were later retroactively compiled by West Publishing into a separate Reporter, Federal Cases. The fourth and current Federal Reporter Series Publishes Decisions of the United States Courts of Appeals and the United States Court of Federal Claims ; prior Series had varying Scopes that covered Decisions of other federal Courts as well. Though the Federal Reporter is an unofficial Reporter and West is a private Company that does not have a legal Monopoly over the Court opinions it publishes, it has so dominated the Industry in the United States that legal Professionals, including Judges, uniformly Cite to the Federal Reporter for included Decisions. Each Year about 30 new Volumes are published."
