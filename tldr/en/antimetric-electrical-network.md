title: "Antimetric electrical network"
short_summary: "Electrical network that exhibits anti-symmetrical electrical properties."
description: "An antimetric electrical Network is an electrical Network which exhibits anti-symmetrical electrical Properties. The Term is often encountered in Filter Theory but it applies to the general electrical Network Analysis. Antimetric is the diametrical Opposite of Symmetric ; it does not merely mean 'asymmetric'. In their electrical Properties it is possible for Networks to be symmetric or antimetric without being physically or topologically symmetric or antimetric."
