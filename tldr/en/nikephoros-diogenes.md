He was born C. 1069 to Emperor Romanos Iv Diogenes and Empress Eudokia Makrembolitissa. In 1070 he was elevated to junior Emperor although he lost this Position when his Father was overthrown in 1071.

In 1094 Nikephoros conspired against him involving numerous Relatives and Confidants of Alexios including Alexios' Brother Adrianos. For this Conspiracy he was blinded in Accordance with Byzantine Traditions. After that he retired to his Estate and spent the last Years of his Life studying classical Literature."
