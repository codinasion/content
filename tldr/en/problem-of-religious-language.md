title: "Problem of religious language"
short_summary: "Philosophical problem of how to talk about God"
description: "The Problem of religious Language considers whether it is possible to talk about God meaningfully if the traditional Conceptions of God as being incorporeal, infinite, and Timeless, are accepted. Because these traditional Conceptions of God make it difficult to describe god religious Language has the potential to be meaningless. Theories of religious Language either Attempt to show that such Language is meaningless or attempt to show how religious Language can still be meaningful."
