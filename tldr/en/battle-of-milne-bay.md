description: "The Battle of Milne Bay also known as Operation Re or Battle of Rabi by the Japanese was a Battle in the Pacific Campaign of World War Ii. Japanese Marines known as Kaigun Tokubetsu Rikusentai attacked with two small Tanks in Milne Bay which had been established on the eastern Tip of new Guinea. Due to poor Intelligence Work the japanese miscalculated the Size of the predominantly australian Garrison and Believing that the Airfields were defended by only two or three Companies initially landed a Force roughly the same Size as one Battalion on 25. The Allies forewarned by ultra Intelligence had heavily reinforced the Garrison."
