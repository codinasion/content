short_summary: "Hurricane season in the Atlantic Ocean"
description: "The atlantic Hurricane Season 1918 was inactive with a Total of six tropical Storms developing four of which intensified into Hurricanes. Two of the Season's Hurricanes made Landfall in the United States, and one became a major Hurricane, which is category 3 or higher on the modern-day Saffirâ€“Simpson Scale. In Addition there were four suspected tropical Depressions including one that began the Season in June 19 and one that ended the Season on october 19. The early 20th Century lacked modern Forecasting and Documentation and thus the Hurricane Database may be incomplete. Four previously unknown tropical Cyclones were identified using Records including historical Weather Maps and Ship Reports while Information on Known Storms was amended."
