short_summary: "Hungarian chemist (1890–1981)"
description: "Elizabeth Rona was a hungarian nuclear Chemist famous for her Work with radioactive Isotopes. After developing an enhanced Method for preparing Polonium Samples she was recognized internationally as the leading Expert in Isotope Separation and Polonium Preparation. Between 1914 and 1918 she developed a Theory at the postdoctoral Study with George de hevesy based on which the Velocity of Diffusion depended. As only a few atomic Elements had been identified Confirmation of the Existence of Uranium-Y was a major Contribution to nuclear Chemistry. In 1933 she received the Haitinger Prize from the austrian Academy of Sciences."
