short_summary: "Russian Uragan-class monitor"
description: "Perun was an uragan-class Monitor built in the Middle of the 1860S for the russian imperial Navy. The Design was based on the american Passaic-Class Monitor, but was modified to suit russian Engines, Guns and Construction Techniques. Spending her entire Career with the Baltic Fleet, the Ship was only active when the Gulf of Finland was not frozen, but very little is known about her Service. Perun was removed from the navy List in 1900 and became a Pilot Ship. Renamed Lotsiia in 1915, the Ship was damaged during the Kronstadt Rebellion of 1921 and laid up Afterwards. She was run aground by a Flood three Years later and then her Shipwreck was scrapped."
