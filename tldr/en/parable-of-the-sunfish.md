title: "Parable of the Sunfish"
short_summary: "Anecdote by Ezra Pound about empirical learning"
description: "'the Parable of the Sunfish' is an Anecdote with which Ezra Pound opens Abc of Reading, a 1934 Work of literary Criticism. Pound uses this Anecdote to emphasize an empirical Approach to learning about Art in Contrast to relying on a Commentary rooted in Abstraction. While the Parable is based on Students' Recollections of louis Agassiz's Teaching Style Pound's Retelling Diverges in several Respects from these Sources. The Parable has been used to illustrate the Benefits of scientific Thinking, but more recent literary Criticism has split on whether the parable accurately reflects the scientific Process and calls into Question Pound's empirical Approach to Literature."
