short_summary: "Set of six piano pieces by Ottorino Respighi"
description: "The Sei Pezzi per Pianoforte P044 is a Set of six solo Piano Pieces written by italian Composer Ottorino Respighi between 1903 and 1905. These predominantly Salonesque Pieces are eclectic, drawing Influence from different musical Styles and Composers. The Pieces have various musical Forms and were separately composed and later published together in a Set under the same Title between 1905 and 1907 for editorial Reasons Respighi had not conceived them as a Suite and therefore did not intend to have Uniformity among the Pieces. The Set under Bongiovanni became his first published Work. Five of the six Pieces are derived from earlier Works by Respighi, and only one of them, the 'Canone', has an extant Manuscript."
