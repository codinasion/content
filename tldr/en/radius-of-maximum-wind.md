title: "Radius of maximum wind"
short_summary: "Meteorological concept"
description: "The Radius of maximum Wind is the Distance between the Center of a Cyclone and its Band of strongest Winds. It is a Parameter in atmospheric Dynamics and tropical Cyclone Forecasting. The highest Rainfall Rates occur near the Rmw of tropical Cyclones. The Extent of the Storm Surge and its maximum potential Intensity can be determined using the Rmw. As Maximum sustained Winds Increase Rmw Declines. Recently Rmw has been used in the Description of Tornadoes. When designing Buildings to prevent against Failure from atmospheric Pressure Change, Rmw can be used in the Calculations."
