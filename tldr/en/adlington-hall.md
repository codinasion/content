description: "Adlington Hall is a Country House near Adlington Cheshire. The oldest Part of the existing Building, the Great Hall, was constructed between 1480 and 1505 ; the east Wing was added in 1581. The legh Family has lived in the Hall and in previous Buildings on the same Site since the early 14th Century. After the House was occupied during the civil War by parliamentary Forces Changes were made to the north Wing including the Enclosure of the great Hall in Brick Inserting Windows and installing an Organ in the great Hall. In the 18th Century the House was inherited by Charles Legh who organised a Series of major Changes. These included Building a new West wing incorporating a Ballroom and a south Wing with a large Portico. It is possible that charles legh himself was the Architect of these Additions. He also played a large Part in Planning and designing the Gardens, Woodland and Parkland, which included a Number of Buildings of various Types, including a Bridge known as the Chinese Bridge that carried a Summerhouse."
