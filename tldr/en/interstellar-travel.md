title: "Interstellar travel"
short_summary: "Hypothetical travel between stars or planetary systems"
description: "Interstellar Travel is the hypothetical Travel of Spacecraft from a single Star System to another. There is a great Possibility that interstellar Travel will be much more difficult than interplanetary Spaceflight due to the vast Difference in the Scale of the involved Distances. Whereas the Distance between any two Planets in the Solar System is less than 55 astronomical Units, Stars are typically separated by Hundreds of Thousands of Au, causing these Distances to typically be expressed instead in Light-Years. Because of the Vastness of these Distances, non-generational Interstellar Travel based on known Physics would need to occur at a high Percentage of the Speed of Light ; even so, Travel Times would be long, at least Decades and perhaps millennia or longer."
