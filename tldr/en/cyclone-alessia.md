description: "Tropical Cyclone Alessia was the first tropical Storm to affect the northern Territory of Australia in November since Cyclone Joan in 1975. The Storm was first identified on november 20 2013 as a tropical Low to the Northwest of Australia. The small System generally from West to west organized slowly into a tropical Cyclone by november 22. Maintaining a small central Dense Overcast, Alessia brushed the Kimberley Region before making Landfall in the top End Region with Winds of 65 Km/H on 23 and 24 November respectively. A little Weakening occurred as the System moved over Land however Reorganization occurred as it neared the Gulf of Carpentaria. After moving over Water on 26 November, it redeveloped gale-force Winds. Alessia reached its peak Intensity on november 27 with Winds of 85 Kmh and a barometric Pressure of 991mbar and then made its final Landfall near Wollogorang. Weakening ensued once again as the Storm moved over the Land though Alessia's Remnants moved Eastwards over Water before doubling to the West. The System was last noted moving Inland over the northern Territory on 1 December."
