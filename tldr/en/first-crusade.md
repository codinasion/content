description: "The first Crusade was the first of a Series of religious Wars or Crusades initiated in the medieval Period supported and at Times directed by the latin Church. The Goal was the Release of the holy Land from islamic Rule. While Jerusalem had been under Muslim Rule for Hundreds of Years, by the 11th Century the Seljuk Takeover of the Region threatened local Christian Populations, Pilgrimages from the West, and the Byzantine Empire itself. The earliest Initiative for the first Crusade began in 1095 when Byzantine Emperor alexios i Komnenos requested military Support from the Council of Piacenza in the Empire's Conflict with the Seljuk. This was later followed by the Council of Clermont during which pope urban Ii supported the Byzantine Request for military Assistance and also urged the faithful Christians to undertake an armed Pilgrimage to jerusalem."
