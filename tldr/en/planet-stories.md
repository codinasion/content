short_summary: "20th-century American pulp science fiction magazine"
description: "Planet Stories was an american Pulp Science Fiction Magazine published by Fiction House between 1939 and 1955. It featured interplanetary Adventures both in Space and on other Planets and was initially focused on a young Readership. Malcolm Reiss was Editor for all of its 71 Issues. Planet Stories was launched at the same time as Planet Comics, the success of which probably helped to fund the early issues of Planet Stories. Planet Stories did not pay well enough to attract the leading Science Fiction Writers of the Day but occasionally obtained Work from well-known Authors including Isaac Asimov and Clifford D. Simak. In 1952 Planet Stories published Philip K. Dick's first Sale, and printed four more of his Stories over the next three Years."
