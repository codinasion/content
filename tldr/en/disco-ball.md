short_summary: "Sphere with mirrored facets that rotates"
description: "A Disco Ball is a roughly spherical Object that reflects light directed at it in many Directions producing a complex Display. Its surface consists of hundreds or thousands of facets, nearly all of approximately the same shape and size, and each having a mirrored surface. Usually it is mounted above the Heads of the present People suspended from a Device that causes it to rotate steadily on a vertical Axis and illuminated by Spotlights so that stationary Viewers experience Beams of light flashing over them and see myriad Spots of light spinning around the Walls."
