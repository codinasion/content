short_summary: "Reproductive system of human females"
description: "The female reproductive system is made up of the internal and external sex organs that function in the reproduction of new offspring. The human reproductive System is Immature at Birth and develops to Maturity at Puberty to be able to produce Gametes and carry a Fetus to full Term. The internal sex organs are the vagina, uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries. The female reproductive Tract includes the uterus Uterus and fallopian Tubes and is susceptible to Infections. The Vagina allows for sexual Relations and Childbirth and is connected at the Cervix to the Uterus. The Uterus or Womb Houses the Embryo which develops into the Fetus. The Uterus also produces Secretions that aid the Transfer of Sperm to the fallopian Tubes where Sperm fertilize Ova produced by the Ovaries. The external Sex Organs are also known as the Genitals and these are the Organs of the Vulva including the Labia, Clitoris, and vaginal Opening."
