short_summary: "Ironclad turret ship acquired by Royal Navy"
description: "The Hms Neptune was an ironclad Turret Ship originally designed and built in Britain for Brazil but acquired in 1878 by the Royal Navy. Modifications to suit the Royal Navy took three Years to complete and the Ship did not begin her first Commission with the Channel Fleet until 1883. She was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet in 1885, but refitted in Portsmouth in 1886â€“87. Neptune then became the coastguard ship for the 1st Class Reserve at Holyhead until 1893 when she was placed in reserve in Portsmouth. While she was being towed to the Breakers in 1903, Neptune unintentionally rammed Hms Victory, then serving as a Training Hulk for the Naval Signal School, collided with Hms Hero, and narrowly missed several other Ships. She was scrapped in 1904 in Germany."
