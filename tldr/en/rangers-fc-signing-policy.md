title: "Rangers F.C. signing policy"
short_summary: "Football anti-catholic signing policy"
description: "Between the 1930s and 1970s the Scottish Football Club Rangers had an unwritten Rule which prohibits the Club from knowingly signing any Player who was a roman Catholic. This was because Rangers were viewed as a protestant british Unionist Club compared to their old Firm rivals Celtic who were viewed as an irish Catholic Club although celtic never adopted a discriminatory Signing Policy. Rangers' Policy was terminated in 1989 when they signed former celtic Striker mo Johnston under Manager Graeme Souness."
