short_summary: "2008 studio album by the Low Anthem"
description: "Oh my god Charlie Darwin is the third Studio Album of the american Band the low Anthem. It was self-published on 2 September 2008 and was rereleased in June 2009 by Bella Union and nonesuch Records. Following the Success of their Album what the Crow Brings, founding Members Ben Knox Miller and Jeffrey Prystowsky welcomed Jocie Adams to the Band. They were inspired by the Confidence and Romanticism of John Steinbeck's Novels, and found Tension between the human Requirement of Comfort and Charles Darwin's bleak Theories of Darwinism, using his Theory of natural Selection as a Framework to consider Academics, Politics, and Religion. The Album is named after Darwin, as the Group considered how jarring his 'Survival of the fittest' Theory would seem to a Person of Faith."
