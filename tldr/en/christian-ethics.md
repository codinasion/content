title: "Christian ethics"
short_summary: "Branch of theology that defines virtuous and sinful behavior from a Christian perspective"
description: "Christian Ethics also known as moral Theology is a multi-faceted ethical System. It is a virtue ethic focusing on building moral Character and a deontological Ethic which emphasizes Duty. It also incorporates natural Law Ethics, which is built on the Belief that it is the very Nature of Humans – created in the Image of God and capable of Morality, Cooperation, Rationality, Discernment and so on – that informs how Life should be lived, and that Awareness of Sin does not require special Revelation. Other Aspects of christian Ethics represented by Movements such as social Gospel and Liberation Theology may be combined into a fourth Area sometimes called prophetic Ethics."
