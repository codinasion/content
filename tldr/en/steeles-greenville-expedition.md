description: "Steele's greenville Expedition took Place during the Vicksburg Campaign of the american civil War between 2 and 25 April 1863. Union Forces commanded by major general Frederick Steele occupied greenville Mississippi and operated in the surrounding Area to divert confederate Attention from a more important Movement made by major general John a. Mcclernand's Corps. Minor Fighting between the two Sides occurred especially during the early Stages of the Expedition. During the Operation more than 1000 Slaves were freed and large Quantities of Supplies and Animals were destroyed or removed from the Area. Along with other Operations including Grierson's Raid Steele's greenville Expedition distracted confederate Attention from Mcclernand's Movement.
