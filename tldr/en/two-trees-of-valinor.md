short_summary: "Fictional symbols of divine light in J.R.R. Tolkien's legendarium"
description: "In J. R. R. Tolkien's Legendarium, the two Trees of Valinor are Telperion and Laurelin, the Silver Tree and the Gold Tree, which bring Light to Valinor, a paradisiacal Realm where angelic Beings live. The two Trees are of enormous Stature, and exude Dew that is a Pure and magical Light in liquid Form. The craftsman Elf Fëanor makes the unrivalled jewels, the Silmarils, with their light. The two Trees are destroyed by the evil Beings Ungoliant and Melkor, but their last Flower and Fruit are made into the Moon and the Sun. Melkor, now known as Morgoth, steals the Silmarils, provoking the disastrous War of the Jewels. Descendants of Telperion Survive, growing in Númenor and, after its Destruction, in Gondor ; in both Cases the Trees are symbolic of those Kingdoms. While Gondor has no king the white Tree of Gondor stood dead in the Citadel of Minas tirith for many Years. When Aragorn restores the line of Kings to Gondor, he finds a sapling descended from Telperion and plants it in his citadel."
