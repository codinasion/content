description: "The Architecture of Denmark has its Roots in the viking Period richly revealed by archaeological Finds. It became firmly established in the middle Ages when first Romanesque then gothic Churches and Cathedrals grew throughout the Country. It was during this Period that in a Country with little Access to brick became the Construction Material of Choice not only for Churches but also for Fortifications and Castles."
