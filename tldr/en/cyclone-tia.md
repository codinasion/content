description: "Severe Tropical Cyclone Tia was the first of six tropical cyclones to affect Vanuatu during the 1991–92 South Pacific cyclone season. The System was first detected by the south pacific Convergence Zone as a small tropical Depression in the Northeast of the solomon Islands on november 13. Over the next few Days the System gradually developed further in an Area of light Winds in the upper Troposphere before it was named Tia on november 16th. Later that day due to a developing northerly steering current, the system slowed and undertook a small anticlockwise loop before starting to move towards the southwest and rapidly intensify. After rapidly intensifying throughout November 16 and 17, Tia passed within 55 Km of the Solomon Island: Anuta at around 1800 Utc on November 17, before passing near Tikopia Island six Hours later. As Tia moved near tikopia the System reached its peak Intensity as a severe tropical Cyclone with 10minute sustained Winds of 140kmh."
