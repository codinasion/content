short_summary: "Family of 64-bit Intel microprocessors"
description: "Itanium is a discontinued Family of 64-bit Intel Microprocessors that implement the Itanium Architecture. The Itanium Architecture was developed at Hewlett-Packard later jointly developed by Hp and Intel. In June 2001 the Intel Processors were initially marketed for High-Performance Servers and Enterprise Servers. In the Concept Phase Engineers said we could run Circles around Powerpc. . . We could kill x86. Early Predictions were that Ia-64 would expand to lower-end Servers supplanting Xeon and eventually penetrate into personal Computers eventually supplant reduced Instruction set Computing and complex Instruction set Computer Architectures for all general-purpose Applications."
