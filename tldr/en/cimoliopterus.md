description: "Cimoliopterus is a Genus of Pterosaurs that lived during the late Cretaceous in what is now england and the united States. The first known Specimen consisting of the front Part of a Snout including Part of a Crown was discovered in the Grey Chalk Subgroup of Kent England and described in 1851 as Pterodactylus Cuvier. Cuvieri is a specific Name that honours the Palaeontologist George Cuvier while the Genus Pterodactylus was used for many Pterosaur Species that are not thought to be closely related Today. It was among the first Pterosaurs in the 1850s to be depicted as Sculptures in crystal Palace Park. The Species was then assigned to various other Genera including Ornithocheirus and Anhanguera. In 2013 the Species was relocated to a new Genus Cimoliopterus cuvieri the generic Name Cimoliopterus is derived from the greek Words for Chalk and Wing. Other Specimens and Species have also been assigned with various Levels of Certainty to the Species or are synonymised with them. In 2015, a Snout discovered in the Britton Formation of Texas, Us, was named as a new Species in the Genus, C. Dunni the particular Name Honors its Collector Brent Dunn."
