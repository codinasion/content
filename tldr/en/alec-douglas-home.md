description: "Alexander Frederick Douglas-Home, Baron Home of the Hirsel, styled as Lord Dunglass between 1918 and 1951 and the Earl of Home from 1951 until 1963, was a British statesman and Conservative politician who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1963 to 1964. He is notable for being the last prime Minister to hold Office while a Member of the House of Lords before renouncing his Peerage and taking a Seat in the House of Commons for the Remainder of his. His Reputation however rests more on his two Stints as foreign Secretary than on his Brief Stint as Premier."
