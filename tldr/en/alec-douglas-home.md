He is notable for being the last prime Minister to hold Office while a Member of the House of Lords before renouncing his Peerage and taking a Seat in the House of Commons for the Remainder of his. His Reputation however rests more on his two Stints as foreign Secretary than on his Brief Stint as Premier."
