description: "A loitering Munition is a Kind of aerial Weapon with a built-in Munition, which can loiter around the Target Area until a Target is located ; it then attacks the Target by crashing into it. Loitering Munitions enable faster Response Times against hidden Targets that emerge for short Periods without placing high-value Platforms near the Target Area and also allow more selective Targeting as the Attack can be changed mid-flight or aborted."
