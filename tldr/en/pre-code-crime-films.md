short_summary: "Film genre popular before The Hays Code"
description: "The Era of american Film Production from the early Sound Era to the Enforcement of the Hays Code in 1934 is designated as Pre Code Hollywood. The Era contained Violence and Crime in Pictures which would not be seen again until Decades later. Although the Hays Office had specifically recommended Removing Profanity, the Drug Trade, and Prostitution from Pictures, it had never officially recommended against Depictions of Violence in any Form in the 1920s. However the State Censor Boards produced their own Guidelines and in particular new York developed a List of violent Material which had to be removed for a Picture to be shown in the State. Two main Types of Crime Films were released during the Period: the Gangster Picture and the Prison Film."
