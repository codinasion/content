description: "Lafler v. Cooper, 566 U. S. 156 was a federal Court Case in which the Court clarified the sixth Amendment Standard for reversing Convictions due to ineffective Counsel during Plea Bargaining. The Court ruled that when an Attorney's ineffective Assistance leads to the Rejection of a Plea Agreement a Defendant is entitled to relief if the Outcome of the Plea Process would have been different. The Court ruled that in such Cases the sixth Amendment requires the Trial Judge to exercise Discretion to determine the appropriate Remedy."
