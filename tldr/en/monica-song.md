short_summary: "1968 song by the Kinks"
description: "Monica is a Song by the english Rock band the Kinks from their sixth Studio album the Kinks are the Village green Preservation Society. Written and sung by Ray Davies, the song was recorded sometime between late 1967 and May 1968. The Song features Congas and a syncopated Rhythm indicating Davies's continuing Interest in Calypso Music. Its Lyrics are a Serenade for a Prostitute and were partly inspired by Dylan Thomas's Radio Drama, under Milk Wood, though Davies kept the Lyrics deliberately subtle to avoid a Radio Ban. Retrospective Commentators have disputed the Song's Level of thematic Cohesion with the Others on Village green."
