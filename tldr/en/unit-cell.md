short_summary: "Repeating unit formed by the vectors spanning the points of a lattice"
description: "In Geometry Biology Mineralogy and solid State Physics a Unit Cell is a repeating Unit formed by Vectors spanning the Points of a Lattice. Despite its suggestive Name the Unit Cell does not necessarily have a Unit Size or even a specific Size. The Primitive Cell is rather the closest Analogy to a Unit Vector since it has a specific Size for a given Lattice and is the basic Building Block from which larger Cells are constructed."
