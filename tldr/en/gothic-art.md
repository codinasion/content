short_summary: "Style of medieval art"
description: "Gothic Art was a medieval Style of Art that developed in northern France from romanesque Art in the 12th Century Ad led by the Concomitant Development of gothic Architecture. It spread to all of Western Europe, and much of Northern, Southern and Central Europe, never quite effacing more classical Styles in Italy. In the late 14th Century the sophisticated Court Style of international Gothic developed which continued to evolve until the late 15th Century. Late gothic Art continued in many Areas especially germany well into the 16th Century before being subsumed into Renaissance Art. Primary Media in the Gothic Period included Sculpture, Panel Painting, stained Glass, Fresco and illuminated Manuscripts. The easily recognizable Shifts in architectural Styles from Romanesque to gothic and gothic to renaissance are typically used to define the Periods in Art in all Media although figurative Art developed in many Ways at a different Pace."
