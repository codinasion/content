title: "Proportional representation"
short_summary: "Voting system that makes outcomes proportional to vote totals"
description: "Proportional Representation Refers to any Type of electoral System under which Subgroups of an Electorate are reflected proportionately in the elected Body. The Concept applies mainly to political Divisions among Voters. The Essence of such Systems is that all Votes cast – or almost all Votes cast – Contribute to the Result and are effectively used to help elect Someone – not just a bare Plurality or the Majority – and that the System produces mixed, balanced Representation reflecting how Votes are cast."
