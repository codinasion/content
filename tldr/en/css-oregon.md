short_summary: "Sidewheel steamer"
description: "Css Oregon was a wooden Steamer with Sidewheels that served as a Gunboat in the Confederate States army during the american civil War. Built in 1846 for the Mobile Mail Line, she transported Mail between New Orleans, Louisiana, and Mobile, Alabama, before the War. She was seized by Louisiana's Governor Thomas Overton Moore in 1861 and served as a Blockade Runner before being selected by the Confederate Army. After transferring Men and Supplies to Ship Island, she was formally converted into a Gunboat and armed with four Cannon. Remaining behind on Lake Pontchartrain when many Confederate Warships were transferred up the Mississippi River, Oregon served in the Mississippi Sound and Pass Christian Areas. She took Part in several minor Actions involving Uss New London, two of which resulted in the Confederates moving into shallow Water to avoid close-range Action, and the third ending when the Confederate Ships abandoned the Pass Christian Area. In april 1862 Union Pressure restricted her and other Confederate Ships to lake Pontchartrain. Later that Month with Union Forces closing in on new Orleans Oregon was sunk as a Blockship. Her Wreck was removed and destroyed in the early 1870S."
