short_summary: "Species of atoms with a specific number of protons"
description: "A Chemical Element is a Chemical Substance which can not be broken down by chemical Reactions into other Substances. The basic Particle that constitutes a Chemical Element is the Atom. Chemical Elements are identified by the Number of Protons in the Nuclei of their Atoms known as the atomic Number of the Element. For Example, Oxygen has an atomic Number of 8, meaning that each Oxygen Atom has 8 Protons in its Nucleus. Two or more Atoms of the same Element can combine to form Molecules unlike Chemical Compounds or Mixtures which contain Atoms of different Elements. In nuclear Reactions Atoms can be transformed into different Elements which change the Number of the Atoms."
