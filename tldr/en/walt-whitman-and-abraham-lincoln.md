short_summary: "Relationship between 19th century poet and politician"
description: "The american Poet Walt Whitman greatly admired Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of the United States, and was deeply affected by his Assassination, writing several Poems as Elegies and giving a Series of Lectures on Lincoln. They never met. Shortly after Lincoln was killed in april 1865 whitman hastily wrote the first of his Lincoln poems hush'd be the Camps to-day. In the following Months, he wrote two more: 'O Captain! My Captain! ' and 'When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd'. Both appeared in his Collection Sequel to Drum-Taps later that Year. The poems—particularly 'my Captain! '—were well received and popular upon publication and, in the following years, Whitman styled himself as an interpreter of Lincoln. In 1871, his fourth Poem on Lincoln, 'this Dust Was once the Man', was published, and the four were grouped together as the 'President Lincoln's Burial Hymn' Cluster in Passage to India. In 1881, the Poems were republished in the 'Memories of President Lincoln' Cluster of Leaves of Grass."
