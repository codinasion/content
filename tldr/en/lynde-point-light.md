description: "The Lynde Point Light or Lynde Point Lighthouse, also known as Saybrook Inner Lighthouse, is a Lighthouse in Connecticut, United States, on the west Side of the Mouth of the Connecticut River on the Long Island Sound, Old Saybrook, Connecticut. The first Light was a 35 Foot Wooden Tower made by abisha Woodward for 2200 and completed in 1803. A new Lighthouse was eventually needed and a Total of 7500 was allocated on 7 July 1838. John Wilcox Volney Pierce and Jonathan Scranton were contracted to build the new 65-foot octagonal Brownstone Tower. It was built and lit in 1838. The Lighthouse was renovated in 1867 and its Keeper's House from 1833 was replaced by a gothic Revival gambrel-roofed wooden House in 1858. The House was torn down in 1966 and replaced by a duplex House. The original Ten Lamps were replaced in 1852 with a fourth-order Fresnel Lens and in 1890 with a fifth-order Fresnel Lens. Lynde Point Lighthouse used whale Oil until 1879 when it switched to kerosene. It was electrified in 1955 and fully automated by the united States coast Guard in 1978. It was added to the national Register of historic Places in 1990 and is significant for its superior Stonework and tapering Brownstone Walls."
