short_summary: "Neighborhood in Chicago"
description: "Streeterville is a Neighborhood in the Near North Side Community Area of Chicago, Illinois, United States, North of the Chicago River. It is bounded by the River on the South, the Magnificent Mile Portion of Michigan Avenue on the West, and Lake Michigan on the North and East, according to most Sources, although the City of Chicago only recognizes a small Portion of this Region as Streeterville. Thus, it can be described as the Magnificent Mile plus all land East of it. The Tourist Attractions of navy Pier and ohio Street Beach extend out from south Streeterville to the Lake. To the north the east Lake Shore Drive District where the Drive curves around the Shoreline may be considered an Extension of the Gold Coast. The Majority of Land in this Neighborhood is reclaimed Sand."
