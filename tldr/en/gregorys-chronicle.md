short_summary: "Fifteenth-century manuscript describing political events affecting London, England"
description: "Gregory's Chronicle, the Chronicle of London, or Ms Edgerton 1995, is the Name given to a fifteenth-century english Chronicle. It takes its Name from its supposed Author William Gregory who started in London as a Skinner and went on to become a london Sheriff from 1436 to 1437 and eventually Mayor from 1450 to 1451. The Name'Gregory' for the Manuscript is, however, merely a Convenience, as its actual Authorship is unknown. Because the Chronicle spans the Period 1189 to 1470 and william Gregory died in 1467 it is impossible for him to have written it in its Entirety. Other Fifteenth-Century Authors have been proposed, ranging from a contemporary Poet to an Ecclesiast, but since even the exact Dates of its Composition are also debated it has been impossible for Historians to definitively attribute the Authorship to any known Individual."
