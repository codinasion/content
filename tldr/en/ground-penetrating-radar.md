short_summary: "Geophysical method that uses radar pulses to image the subsurface"
description: "Ground penetrating Radar is a geophysical Method that uses Radar Pulses to Image the Subsurface. It is a non-intrusive Method of surveying the Subsurface to investigate underground Utilities such as Cement Concrete Asphalt Metals pipes Cables or Masonry. This nondestructive Method uses electromagnetic Radiation in the Microwave Band of the Radio Spectrum and detects the Reflections of Subsurface Structures. Gpr can have Applications in a Variety of Materials including Rock Soil Ice fresh Water Pavements and Structures. In the right Conditions, Practitioners can use Gpr to detect Subsurface Objects, Changes in Material Properties, and Voids and Cracks."
