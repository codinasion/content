title: "Ultrasonography of chronic venous insufficiency of the legs"
short_summary: "Non-invasive medical procedure"
description: "Ultrasonography for the Diagnosis of suspected or previously confirmed chronic venous Insufficiency of Leg Veins is a risk-free non-invasive Procedure. It gives Information about the Anatomy, Physiology and Pathology of mainly superficial Veins. As with Heart Ultrasound Studies venous Ultrasonography requires an Understanding of Hemodynamics in Order to give useful Examination Reports. In chronic venous Insufficiency, sonographic Examination is of most Benefit ; in confirming varicose Disease, making an Assessment of the Hemodynamics, and charting the Progression of the Disease and its Response to Treatment. It has become the Reference Standard for examining the Condition and Hemodynamics of lower Limb Veins. The specific Veins of the deep venous System and the superficial venous System are examined. The large saphenous Vein and the small saphenous Vein are superficial Veins which drain into the common femoral Vein and the Popliteal Vein respectively. These veins are deep veins. Perforator Veins drain superficial Veins into deep Veins. Three anatomic Compartments are described, containing the deep Veins, containing the Perforator Veins, and containing the superficial Veins, known as the saphenous Compartment. This Compartmentalisation makes it easier for the Examiner to systematize and map. The Gsv can be located in the saphenous Compartment where together with the Giacomini Vein and the Accessory saphenous Vein can be seen a Representation of an Eye known as the'Eye Sign'. The Asv which is often responsible for varicose Veins can be located at the Alignment Sign where it is seen to align with the femoral Vessels."
