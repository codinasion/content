short_summary: "Class of battlecruisers of the Royal Navy"
description: "The Class G3 was a Class of Battlecruisers planned by the Royal navy after World War I in Response to naval Expansion Programmes by the united States and Japan. The four Ships of this Class would have been bigger faster and more heavily armed than any existing Battleship. The G3S have been considered to be appropriate fast Battleships since they were well-balanced Designs with adequate Protection. However the Class was officially designated as a Battlecruiser due to their higher Speed and lesser Firepower and armour Relative to the planned N3-Class Battleship Design. The G3 would have carried nine 16-inch Guns and were expected to achieve 32 Knots while the N3S would carry nine 18-inch Guns on the same Displacement at the Expense of Speed."
