short_summary: "Genus of azhdarchoid pterosaur from the Early Cretaceous"
description: "Thalassodromeus is a Genus of Pterosaurs that lived about a hundred million Years ago in what is now brazil during the early cretaceous. The original Skull discovered in 1983 in the araripe Basin of northeastern Brazil was collected in several Pieces. In 2002, the Skull was made the holotype Specimen of Thalassodromeus Sethi by Palaeontologists Alexander Kellner and Diogenes De Almeida Campos. The generic name means 'sea runner', and the specific name refers to the Egyptian god Seth due to its crest being supposedly reminiscent of Seth's crown. Other Scholars have pointed out that the Crest was instead similar to the Crown of Amon. A jaw tip was assigned to T. Sethi in 2005, became the Basis of the new Genus Banguela in 2014, and assigned back to Thalassodromeus as the Species T. Oberlii in 2018. In 2015 another Species was described based on a supposed Crest Fragment but this was later shown to be Part of a Turtle Shell."
