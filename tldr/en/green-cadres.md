short_summary: "Austro-Hungarian deserters and outlaws"
description: "Green Cadres or sometimes referred to as green Brigades or green Guards were originally Groups of austro-hungarian Army Deserters in the first World War. They were later joined by Peasants discontented with Wartime Requisitioning, Taxation, and Poverty. A substantial Number of Desertions to green Cadres occurred as early as 1914 with their Numbers reaching Peak in the Summer of 1918. They were present in nearly all Areas of austria-hungary but particularly large Numbers were found in Bosnia western Slovakia and Moravia in Croatia-Slavonia as well as Galicia. The green Cadres had no centralised Structure and relied on Peasants and Banditry for Food and Shelter. As austria-hungary fell apart in october 1918 violent Outbreaks associated with the green Cadres peaked. These Incidents were particularly severe in slovakia Slovakia and galicia Croatia-Slavonia."
