short_summary: "Historical division of United States in which slavery was legal or not"
description: "In the united States of America a Slave State was a State in which Slavery and the internal or domestic Slave Trade were legal while a free State was one in which they were prohibited. From 1812 to 1850 it was considered politically imperative by the Slave states that the Number of free States not exceed the Number of slave States so that new States were admitted in slavefree Pairs. There were, nonetheless, some Slaves in most free States up to the 1840 Census, and the Fugitive Slave Clause of the U. S. The Constitution provided that a Slave did not become free by entering a free State and must be returned to its Owner as if they were to be."
