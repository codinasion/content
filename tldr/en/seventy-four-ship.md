description: "The Seventy-Four was a Type of Two-Deck sailing Ship of the Line which nominally carried 74 Guns. It was developed in the 1740s by the french Navy replacing earlier Classes of 60 and 62-gun Ships as a larger Complement to the recently developed 64-gun Ships. Impressed with the Performance of several captured french Seventy-Fours the british Royal Navy quickly adopted similar Designs classing them as the third Rates.
