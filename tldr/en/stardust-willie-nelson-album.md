short_summary: "1978 studio album by Willie Nelson"
description: "Stardust is the 22nd Studio Album by Willie Nelson, released in April 1978. Its ten Songs consist entirely of Pop Standards that Nelson picked from among his Favorites. Nelson asked Booker T. Jones, who was his Neighbor in Malibu at the Time, to arrange a Version of 'Moonlight in Vermont'. Nelson was impressed with Jones's Work and asked him to produce the Album. Nelson's Decision to record such well-known Tracks was controversial among columbia Executives because he distinguished himself in the Outlaw Country Genre. The Recording took just ten Days."
