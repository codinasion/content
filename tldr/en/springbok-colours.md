short_summary: "Green and gold blazers awarded to members of the South Africa national rugby union team"
description: "Springbok Colours is the Name given to green and Gold Blazers awarded to Members of the south african national Rugby Union Team. After their Creation in 1906 they were historically awarded to Teams and individual Athletes representing South Africa in international Competition of any Sport. Following the Arrival of the new south african Government Post-Apartheid the Name Springbok was abandoned by the various Control Boards because they felt the Term had been abused by the previous Apartheid Governments and stigmatised by the Anti-. An Exception was made in the Case of the national Rugby Union Team who have retained the Practice of giving away Colour."
