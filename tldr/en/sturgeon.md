short_summary: "Ray-finned fish"
description: "Sturgeon is the common Name for 28 Species of fish Belonging to the Family Acipenseridae. The earliest Sturgeon Fossils Date back to the late cretaceous and are descended from other earlier acipenseriform Fish dating back to the early jurassic Period about 174 to 201 million Years ago. They are one of two living Families of the Acipenseriformes alongside Paddlefish. The Family is grouped into four Genera: Acipenser, Huso, Scaphirhynchus, and Pseudoscaphirhynchus. Two Species may be extinct in the wild and one may be completely extinct. Sturgeons are native to the subtropical Temperate and subarctic Rivers Lakes and Coastlines of Eurasia and North America. A maastrichtian-age Fossil found in Morocco Shows that they also once lived in Africa."
