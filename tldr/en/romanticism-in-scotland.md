short_summary: "Artistic, literary and intellectual movement"
description: "Romanticism was an artistic Literary and intellectual Movement that developed between late 18th and early 19th Centuries in Scotland. It was Part of the Wider european Romantic Movement, which was partly a Reaction against the Age of Enlightenment, emphasising individual, national and emotional Responses, moving beyond Renaissance and Classicist Models, particularly into Nostalgia for the Middle Ages. The Concept of a separate national Scottish Romanticism was first articulated by the Critics Ian Duncan and Murray Pittock in the scottish Romanticism in World Literatures Conference held at Uc Berkeley in 2006 and in the Latter's scottish and irish Romanticism, which argued for a national Romanticism based on the Concepts of a distinct national Public sphere and differentiated Inflection of literary Genres ; the Use of Scots Language ; the Creation of a heroic national History through an Ossianic or scottian'taxonomy of Glory' and the Performance of a distinct national Self in Diaspora."
