short_summary: "Scientific discipline"
description: "Food Safety is used as a scientific Methoddiscipline describing handling Preparation and Storage of Food in Ways that prevent foodborne Illnesses. The Occurrence of two or more Cases of similar Illness due to the Ingestion of a common Food is known as a food-borne Disease Outbreak. This includes a Number of Routines that must be followed to avoid potential Health Hazards. In this Way, Food Safety often overlaps with Food Defense to prevent Harm to Consumers. The Tracks within this Line of Thought are Safety between Industry and the Market and then between the Market and the Consumer. In considering industry-to-market Practices, Food Safety Considerations include the Origins of Food including the Practices relating to Food Labeling, Food Hygiene, Food Additives and Pesticide Residues, as well as Policies on Biotechnology and Food and Guidelines for the Management of governmental Import and Export Inspection and Certification Systems for Foods. In considering market-to-consumer Practices the usual Thought is that Food should be safe on the Market and the Concern is the safe Delivery and Preparation of Food for the Consumer. Nutrition and Food Safety are closely related. Unhealthy Food creates a Cycle of Disease and Malnutrition that also affects Infants and Adults."
