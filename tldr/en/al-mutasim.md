short_summary: "8th Abbasid caliph (r. 833–842)"
description: "Ab Isq Muammad ibn Hrn al-rashd better known by his regnal Name al-mutaim Billh was the eighth Abbasid Caliph from 833 until his Death in. As a younger Son of caliph harun Al-Rashid he rose to prominence through his Formation of a private Army comprised predominantly of turkic Slave-Soldiers. This proved useful to his half-brother caliph Al-Ma'Mun who employed Al-Mu'Tasim and his turkish Guard to counterbalance other powerful Interest Groups in the State as well as to employ. When al-ma'mun died in august 833 unexpectedly Al-Mu'Tasim was therefore well placed to succeed him overriding the Claims of Al-Ma'Mun's Son Al-Abbas."
