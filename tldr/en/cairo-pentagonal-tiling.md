title: "Cairo pentagonal tiling"
short_summary: "Tiling of the plane by pentagons"
description: "In geometry, a Cairo pentagonal tiling is a tessellation of the Euclidean plane by congruent convex pentagons, formed by overlaying two tessellations of the plane by hexagons and named for its use as a paving design in Cairo. It is also called Macmahon's Net after Percy Alexander Macmahon who represented it in his 1921 Publication new mathematical Pastimes. John Horton Conway called it a 4-fold Pentille."
