short_summary: "Secretion produced by mucous membranes"
description: "Mucus is a Slippery aqueous Secretion produced by and covering mucous Membranes. It is normally produced from Cells found in mucous Glands although it may also originate from mixed Glands that contain both serous and mucous Cells. It is a viscous Colloid containing inorganic Salts, antimicrobial Enzymes, Immunoglobulins, and Glycoproteins such as Lactoferrin and Mucins, which are produced by Goblet Cells in the mucous Membranes and submucosal Glands. Mucus Serves to protect the Linings of the Respiratory Digestive and urogenital Systems and Structures of the visual and auditory Systems from pathogenic Fungi Bacteria and Viruses. Most of the Mucus produced in the Body is produced in the gastrointestinal Tract."
