short_summary: "Large gravitationally bound system of stars and interstellar matter"
description: "A Galaxy is a System of Stars, stellar Remnants, interstellar Gas, Dust, and dark Matter bound together by Gravity. The word is derived from the Greek galaxias , literally 'milky', a reference to the Milky Way galaxy that contains the Solar System. Galaxies averaging an estimated 100 billion Stars range from Dwarfs with less than 100 million Stars to the largest Galaxies known as Supergiants with a hundred trillion Stars orbiting the Galaxy's Center of Mass. Most of the Mass of a typical Galaxy in the Form of dark Matter is only a few Percent of that Mass Visible in the Form of Stars and Nebulae. Supermassive black Holes are common at the central Centres of Galaxies."
