description: "A Hill Station is a Town situated on a higher Elevation than the nearby Plain or Valley. The English term was originally used mostly in colonial Asia, but also in Africa, for towns founded by European colonialists as refuges from the summer heat and, as Dale Kennedy observes about the Indian context, 'the hill station was seen as an exclusive British preserve: here it was possible to render the Indian into an outsider'. The Term is still used in present Day, particularly in India, which has the largest Number of hill Stations, most are situated at an Altitude of approximately 1,000 to 2,500 Metres."
