short_summary: "Filmmaking technique"
description: "Hand-held Camera or hand-held Photography is a Filmmaking and Video Production Technique where the Camera is held in the Hands of the Camera Operator rather than mounted on a Tripod or other Base. Hand-held Cameras are used because they are compact for traveling and because they allow greater Freedom of Movement during filming. Newsreel Camera Operators often collected Images using a hand-held Camera. Virtually all modern Video Cameras are small enough for hand-held Use but many professional Video Cameras are specifically designed for Hand-Held Use such as electronic News-Gathering and electronic Field Production."
