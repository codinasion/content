title: "Spectrometer"
short_summary: "Used to measure spectral components of light"
description: "A Spectrometer is a scientific Instrument used to separate and measure the spectral Components of a physical Phenomenon. Spectrometer is a broad Term frequently used to describe Instruments that measure a continuous Variable of a Phenomenon where the spectral Components are somehow mixed. A Spectrometer in visible Light can separate white Light and Measure individual narrow Bands of Color called Spectrums. A Mass Spectrometer measures the Spectrum of the Mass of Atoms or Molecules present in a Gas. The first Spectrometers were used to split light into an Array of distinct Colors. Spectrometers were developed in early Studies of Physics astronomy and Chemistry. The Capability of Spectroscopy to determine the Chemical Composition drove its Advancement and continues to be one of its primary Uses. Spectrometers are used in Astronomy to analyze the Chemical Composition of Stars and Planets Spectrometers also gather Data on the Origin of the Universe."
