description: "A Play Clock also known as a delay-of-game Timer is a counting Clock that is designed to speed up the Pace of the Game in Gridiron Football. The offensive Team must put the Ball in Play by either snapping the Ball during a Scrimmage down or kicking the Ball during a free Kick down before the Time expires or they will be assessed a 5-yard Delay of Game or Time Count Violation Penalty. If the official Clock is not available or does not function Officials on the Field will use a Stopwatch or other similar Device to enforce the Rule."
