title: "Augustin-Jean Fresnel"
short_summary: "French optical physicist (1788–1827)"
description: "Augustin-jean Fresnel was a french civil Engineer and Physicist whose Research in Optics led to the almost unanimous Acceptance of the Wave Theory of light excluding any Remnant of Newton's corpuscular Theory from the late 1830s until the End of the. He is perhaps best known for inventing the catadioptric Fresnel Lens and for pioneering the Use of stepped Lenses to extend the Visibility of Lighthouses saving Thousands of Lives at Sea. The Simpler Dioptric stepped Lens first proposed by Count Buffon and independently reinvented by Fresnel is used in screen Magnifiers and Condenser Lenses for overhead Projectors."
