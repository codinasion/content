short_summary: "Imperial Russian Navy's Pervenets-class broadside ironclad"
description: "Pervenets were a Broadside Ironclad built in Britain during the 1860S for the imperial russian Navy. The Ship had to be built abroad as no russian Shipyard had mastered the Techniques required to build iron-hulled armored Vessels. Upon Completion she was assigned to the baltic Fleet and never left russian Waters. Pervenets served with the Gunnery Training Detachment for her entire Career until she was resigned to reserve in 1904. She was disarmed and stricken the following Year and finally sold in 1908. The Ship was reacquired by the Soviets in 1922 after the End of the russian civil War and used to transport and store Coal a Role she performed until discarded in the late 1950S.
