description: "Within the Woods is a 1978 Horror Film scripted and produced by Sam Raimi. Raimi drew inspiration from his earlier short film Clockwork, deciding to produce a proof of concept horror film to help build the interest of potential investors. Raimi cast his Friends bruce Campbell and ellen Sandweiss as the two Protagonists and produced the Film for 1600. The Production was difficult because of the low Budget Shot on Location in a remote Cabin in the Woods. Several of the special Effects presented in the Film were done in a severely low Budget Manner, some of which were improvised on Set. The film centers around demonic possession and mysterious forces originating from the woods."
