description: "Flight unlimited Ii is a 1997 Flight Simulator Game developed by looking Glass Studios and published by Eidos interactive. The Player controls one of five Planes in the Airspace of san francisco Bay Area which is shared with up to 600 artificially intelligent Aircraft controlled by real-time Air Traffic Control. The Game eschews the aerobatic Focus of its Predecessor Flight unlimited in Favor of general civil Aviation. As such, new physics code and an engine were developed, the former because the programmer of Flight Unlimited's computational fluid dynamics system, Seamus Blackley, had left the company."
