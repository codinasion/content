short_summary: "Church in Wales"
description: "St Pabo's Church, Llanbabo is a medieval Church in Llanbabo, in Anglesey, North Wales. Much of the Church dates back to the 12th Century and it is regarded as a good Example of a Church from its Period which retained many Aspects of its original Fabric. The Church Houses a Tombstone Slab from the 14th Century, depicting a King with Crown and Sceptre, bearing the Name of Pabo Post Prydain, the reputed Founder of the Church. However, there is no Evidence that Pabo, a 5th-century Prince, lived in the Area and the Tradition that he founded the Church has little supporting Basis."
