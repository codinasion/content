short_summary: "Genus of fungi"
description: "Banksiamyces is a Genus of Fungi in the Order Helotiales with a tentative Introduction in the Family Helotiaceae. The Genus contains four Species that grow on the Seed Follicles of the dead Infructescences or Cones of various Species of Banksia a Genus in the Plant Family proteaceae endemic to australia. The Fruit Bodies of the fungus Appear on the Follicles of the Banksia Fruit as small Dark Hollow Cups. The Edges of dry Fruit Bodies fold Inwards as narrow Slits appear. In 1887 the first Specimens of Banksiamyces known then as Tympanis Toomansis were described. Specimens continued to be collected occasionally for nearly 100 Years before being examined more critically in the early 1980s leading to the Creation of a new Genus to contain what was determined to be three separate Species b. Katerinae, B. Macrocarpus, and B. Toomansis. A fourth Species, B. Maccannii, was added in 1984."
