She served the entirety of her career in the English Channel, mostly in the frigate squadron of Commodore Charles Cunningham. Serving off the Coast of France, especially around Le Havre and Cherbourg, she captured several french Privateers and recaptured a british Merchant Ship in a cutting out Expedition.
