short_summary: "Area of tort law in England"
description: "Nuisance in English Law is an Area of Tort Law broadly divided into two Torts ; private Nuisance, where the Actions of the Defendant are 'causing a substantial and unreasonable Interference with a's Land or His/Her Use or Enjoyment of that Land', and public Nuisance, where the Defendant's Actions 'materially affects the reasonable Comfort and Convenience of Life of a Class of Her Majesty's Subjects' ; public Nuisance is also a Crime. Both Torts have been present from the Time of Henry Iii, being affected by a Variety of philosophical Shifts through the Years which saw them become first Looser and then far more stringent and less Protecting of an Individual's Rights. In all Tort claims the Claimant must prove that Defendant's Actions caused unreasonable Interference and in some Instances the Intention of the Defendant may also be taken into Account. A significant Difference is that private Nuisance does not allow a Claimant to claim for any personal Injury suffered while public Nuisance does."
