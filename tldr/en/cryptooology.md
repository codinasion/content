short_summary: "2004 studio album by Yowie"
description: "Cryptooology is the Debut Studio Album by american experimental Rock Band Yowie, released by Skin Graft Records on October 5, 2004. A Band of two Guitarists and a Drummer Yowie recorded the Album earlier in the Year at a Studio in their Hometown of St. Louis, Missouri. The Trio wrote and refined the Album's seven instrumental Songs through four Years of Rehearsal, devoting close Attention to every Part of their musicâ€”even Segments that were only a few Seconds long. The resulting Music represents an extreme technically demanding Vein of Math Rock that avoids Conventions of songwriting like Melody or Repetition. Though the Band's Music sounds chaotic or disorienting it is not improvised."
