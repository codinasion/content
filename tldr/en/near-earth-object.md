short_summary: "Small Solar System body whose orbit brings it close to Earth"
description: "A near-earth Object is any small solar System Body whose Orbit around the Sun can bring it near Earth. A small natural solar System Body is generally a Neo by Convention if its closest Neighbor to the Sun is less than 1. 3 astronomical Units. If a Neo's Orbit crosses the Earth's Orbit and the Object is larger than 140 Meters across it is considered a potentially dangerous Object. Most known Phos and Neos are Asteroids, but about 0. 35 % are Comets."
