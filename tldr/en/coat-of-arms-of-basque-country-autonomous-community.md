short_summary: "Coat of arms"
description: "The current Basque Coat of Arms is the official Coat of Arms of the autonomous Basque Country in Spain. It consists of a Party per Cross representing the three historical Territories of √Ålava, Gipuzkoa and Biscay, as well as a fourth, void Quarter. The Arms are ringed with a regal Wreath of Oak Leaves symbolically symbolic of Gernikako Arbola. The fourth Quarter constituted since the late 19th Century the linked Chains of Navarre ; however, following a legal Suit by the Navarre Government claiming that the Usage of the Arms of a Region on the Flag of another was illegal, the Constitutional Court of Spain ordered the Removal of the Chains of Navarre in a Judgement of 1986."
