short_summary: "Dicraeosaurid sauropod dinosaur genus from the Early Cretaceous period"
description: "Amargasaurus is a Genus of sauropod Dinosaurs of the early Cretaceous of what is now argentina. The only known Skeleton was discovered in 1984 and is virtually complete including a fragmentary Skull making amargasaurus one of the best-known Sauropods of its Epoch. Amargasaurus was first described in 1991 and contains a single known Species of Amargasaurus Cazaui. It was a large Animal but small for a Sauropod weighing between 9 and 13 Meters in Length. Most distinctively, it sported two parallel Rows of tall Spines down its Neck and back, Taller than in any other known Sauropod. In Life, these Spines could have stuck out of the Body as solitary Structures that supported a keratinous Sheath. An alternate Hypothesis, now more favored, postulates that they could have formed a scaffold supporting a skin Sail. They might have been used for Display or Defence."
