description: "The Fall of Enugu was a military Conflict between nigerian and biafran Forces during the nigerian civil War which centered around enugu the Capital of the secessionist Republic of Biafra. Shortly after the War broke out nigerian federal Forces have made Enugu's Capture a Priority but their Advance has not been completed until Nsukka. Biafran President and Leader Odumegwu Ojukwu attempted in August to distract the nigerian Army by initiating an Invasion of Nigeria's mid-western Region but the Offensive was brought to a Halt. Colonel theophilus Danjuma commanded nigerian Forces at the nsukka Front and prepared to advance with seven Battalions of the 1st Division at Enugu. Enugu was garrisoned by a Brigade led by Colonel Alexander Madiebo and poorly armed Civilians called into Service. Danjuma decided to launch an offensive with his Forces spread over a broad Front to make it difficult for the Biafrans to block them along major Roads as had happened previously."
