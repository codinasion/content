description: "Ganteaume's Expeditions of 1801 were three connected major french Navy Operations of the Spring of 1801 during the french Revolutionary Wars. A french naval Squadron from brest under contre-amiral Honor Ganteaume seeking to reinforce the besieged french Garrison in ottoman Egypt made three separate but futile Attempts to reach the eastern Mediterranean. The french Army in Egypt had been stuck there shortly after the Start of the napoleonic Campaign in Egypt in 1798 when the french mediterranean Fleet was destroyed in the Battle of the Nile. Since this Defeat the french Navy had maintained only a minimal Presence in the mediterranean Sea while the more numerous british and their Allies had succeeded in blocking and defeating several french Bases almost unopposed."
