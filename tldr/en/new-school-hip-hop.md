short_summary: "Movement in hip hop music"
description: "The new School of Hip Hop was a Movement in Hip Hop Music, beginning in 1983–84 with the early Records of Run–D. M. C. , Whodini, and Ll Cool J. Predominantly from Queens and Brooklyn, it was characterized by drum machine-led Minimalism, often tinged with Elements of Rock ; rapped Taunts, Boasts, and socio-political Commentary ; and aggressive, self-assertive Delivery. In Song and Image, its Artists projected a tough, cool, street b-boy Attitude. These Elements contrasted sharply with Funk and Disco, Novelty Hits, live Bands, Synthesizers, and Party Rhymes of Artists Prevalent in the early 1980s. Compared to their older Hip Hop Counterparts, new School Artists crafted more cohesive Lps and shorter Songs more amenable to airplay. By 1986 their Releases began to establish Hip Hop in the Mainstream."
