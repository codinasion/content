It advocated the Ideals of Freedom, social Justice and social Equality as the main Principles of a well-governed Society, making it the most important theoretical Monument of greek Republicanism. The Author arguing for both social Autonomy and national Sovereignty supported the greek Struggle for national Liberation and turned to the moral Greatness of ancient Greece in Order to stimulate collective Pride.
