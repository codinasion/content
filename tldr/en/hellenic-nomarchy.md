short_summary: "Book by an Anonymous Greek"
description: "Nomarchy was a Pamphlet written by an anonymous Greek that was published and printed in Italy in 1806. It advocated the Ideals of Freedom, social Justice and social Equality as the main Principles of a well-governed Society, making it the most important theoretical Monument of greek Republicanism. The Author arguing for both social Autonomy and national Sovereignty supported the greek Struggle for national Liberation and turned to the moral Greatness of ancient Greece in Order to stimulate collective Pride. Although this Work was widely read by Greeks before the Outbreak of the greek War of Independence in 1821 from its first Appearance it was received with Discomfort by its contemporary Audience and generated later scholarly Debates on the Identity of its Author."
