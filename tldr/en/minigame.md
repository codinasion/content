description: "A Minigame is a short Game often contained within another Video Game. A Minigame contains different Gameplay Elements and is often smaller or simpler than the Game in which it is contained. Some Video Games consist entirely of Minigames which tie into an overall Theme such as the Olympic Decathlon. Minigames can also be used to represent a specific Experience, such as Hacking, Lock Picking, or scanning an Area, that ties into a larger Game."
