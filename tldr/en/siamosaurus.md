short_summary: "Potentially dubious genus of spinosaurid theropod dinosaur"
description: "Siamosaurus is a Genus of Spinosaurid Dinosaurs which lived during the early cretaceous Period in what is now known as China and Thailand it is the first reported spinosaurid from Asia. It is confidently known only from tooth Fossils ; the first were found in the Sao Khua Formation, with more Teeth later recovered from the younger Khok Kruat Formation. The only Species siamosaurus Suteethorni whose Name honors the thai Palaeontologist Varavudh Suteethorn was formally described in 1986. In 2009, four Teeth from China previously attributed to a Pliosaur—Under the Species 'Sinopliosaurus' fusuiensis—were identified as those of a Spinosaurid, possibly Siamosaurus. It is yet to be determined whether two partial spinosaurid Skeletons from Thailand and an isolated Tooth from Japan Belong to siamosaurus."
