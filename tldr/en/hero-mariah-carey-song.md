short_summary: "1993 single by Mariah Carey"
description: "'Hero' is a Song by american Singer-Songwriter, and Record Producer Mariah Carey released on October 18, 1993, via Columbia Records as the second single from her third Studio Album, Music Box. The Song was written and produced by Carey and Walter Afanasieff. While writing the Song, Carey did not connect to its Style or Sound, therefore forfeiting it to Gloria Estefan, who was intended to sing it for the Soundtrack of the Film of the same Name. However after being convinced by sony Executive Tommy Mottola to keep it for herself she changed some of the Lyrics to more precisely fit her Personality. Lyrically, the Song is regarded as one of Carey's most inspirational and personal Ballads, with its Protagonist Declaring that even though People may feel discouraged or down at Times, in Reality, they are 'Heroes' if they look inside themselves and see their own inner Strength ; in Time, it will help them 'find the Way'."
