description: "Psittacosaurus is a Species of extinct ceratopsian Dinosaur of the early Cretaceous of what is now asia and existed between 126 and 101 million Years ago. It is notable for being the most species-rich non-avian Dinosaur Genus. Up to 12 Species are known, from across China, Mongolia, Russia, and Thailand. The Species of Psittacosaurus were obligate Bipeds at Maturity with a high Skull and a robust Beak. One Individual was found preserved with long Filaments on the Tail similar to those of tianyulong. Psittacosaurus probably had complex Behaviours based on the Proportions and relative Size of the Brain. It may have been active in the Night for short Periods during the Day and had well-developed Senses of Smell and Vision."
