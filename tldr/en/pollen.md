short_summary: "Grains containing the male gametophytes of seed plants"
description: "Pollen is a powdery Substance produced by most Types of Flowers of Seed Plants for the Purpose of sexual Reproduction. It consists of Pollen Grains that produce male Gametes. Pollen Grains have a hard Coat made of Sporopollenin that protects Gametophytes during the Process of their Movement from Stamens to Pistils of flowering Plants or from the Male Cone to the female Cone of Gymnosperms. If pollen Lands on a compatible Pistil or female Cone, it germinates, producing a Pollen Tube that transfers the Sperm to the Ovule containing the female Gametophyte. The individual Pollen Grains are small enough to require considerable Magnification to see Detail. The Study of Pollen is called Palynology and is highly useful in Paleoecology Paleontology Archaeology and Forensics. In Plants pollen is used for transferring haploid male genetic Material in Cross-Pollination from an Ananther of a single Flower to the Stigma of another. In a Case of Self-Pollination this Process occurs from the inner Anther of a Flower to the Stigma of the same Flower."
