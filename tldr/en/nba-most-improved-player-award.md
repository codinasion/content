short_summary: "National Basketball Association award"
description: "The national Basketball Association most improved Player Award is an annual Award given to the Player who has shown the most progress during the regular Season compared to previous Seasons. The Winner is selected by a Panel of Sportswriters who each Cast a Vote for first second and third Places. Each first-place Vote is worth five Points each second-place Vote is worth three Points and each third-place Vote is worth one Point. The Player with the highest total Points Regardless of Number of first-place Votes wins the Award. The Criteria for selecting the most improved Player was initially open-ended, but the Nba clarified in later Years that it was intended for an up-and-coming Player who improved dramatically and not a Player who made a Comeback, distinguishing it from the defunct Nba Comeback Player of the Year Award. Since 202223 the Nba Season Winners receive the George mikan Trophy named after the five-time Nba Champion."
