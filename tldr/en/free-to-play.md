short_summary: "Video game industry business model"
description: "Free-to-play Games are Games that give Players Access to a significant Part of their Content without paying or do not require paying to continue playing. Free-To-Play is distinct from traditional commercial Software which requires a Payment before using the Game or Service. It is also separate from Freeware Games which are all cost-free. The free-to-play Model is often ridiculed as free-to-start due to not being entirely free. Free to play Games have also been widely criticized as 'pay-to-win' — that is, that Players can generally pay to obtain competitive or Power Advantages over other Players."
