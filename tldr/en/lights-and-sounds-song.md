description: "Lights and sounds is a Song by the american Pop Punk Band Yellowcard. The Song was written collaboratively by all the Band Members for their fifth Album, Lights and Sounds. The Track is built around a Guitar Riff which is then followed by a repetitive Drum Beat then followed by a Roaring Guitar Sound. The Lyrics are based on the Band coping with the Success they experienced when writing Songs for their second Album. It is also based on how they have aged in the Process. 'Lights and Sounds' also goes with what Vocalist Ryan Key described as when he was preoccupied with making the Album."
