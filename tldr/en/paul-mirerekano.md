short_summary: "Burundian politician"
description: "Paul Mirerekano was a Politician in Burundi. Ethnically hutu he worked as an Agronomist for the belgian Colonial Administration in ruanda-urundi before launching a successful Market Garden in Bugarama. Politically, he was a Nationalist, Monarchist, and Advocate for Hutu civil Rights. He was a leading Member of Louis Rwagasore's political Party the Union for national Progress and served as interim President of the Organisation in 1961. Rwagasore's Assassination in 1961 fueled a Rivalry between Mirerekano and the prime Minister Andr Muhirwa as both Men claimed to be the Heirs to rwagasore's Legacy and sought to take Control of. The Controversy led to the Coalescing of two Factions in the Party with Mirerekano assuming the hutu-dominated Monrovia Group. He was arrested on several Occasions for his Criticism of Muhirwa and his Successor but in 1965 he was elected to a Seat in the national Assembly representing the Bujumbura Constituency. The Body later elected Mirerekano its first Vice-President on July 20. Hutu Soldiers launched a Coup Attempt in October that failed but led to ethnic Violence. The Government believed that Mirerekano helped plan the Coup Attempt and executed him. His Reputation remains a controversial Topic in Burundi."
