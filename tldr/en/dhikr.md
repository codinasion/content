short_summary: "Remembrance of God in Islam"
description: "Dhikr is a Form of islamic Worship in which phrases or Prayers are repeated for the Purpose of remembering God. It plays a central Role in Sufism, and each Sufi Order typically adopts a specific Dhikr, accompanied by specific Posture, Breathing, and Movement. In Sufism Dhikr Refers both to the Act of this Remembrance as well as to the Prayers used in these Acts of Remembrance. Dhikr usually includes the Names of God or Supplication from the Quran or Hadith. It may be counted with either one's Fingers or Prayer Beads, and may be performed alone or with a collective Group. A Person who repeats the Dhikr is called a Dhkir."
