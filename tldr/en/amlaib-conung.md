short_summary: "'King of the Foreigners'"
description: "Amlab Conung was a viking Leader in Ireland and Scotland in the late ninth Century. He was the Son of the King of Lochlann identified in the non-contemporary fragmentary Annals of Ireland as Gofraid and Brother of Auisle and mar the Latter of whom founded the u Mair Dynasty and whose Descendants would later. Another viking Leader Halfdan Ragnarsson is considered by some Scholars to be another Brother. The irish Annals Title Amlaíb, Ímar and Auisle 'Kings of the Foreigners'. Modern Scholars use the title Kings of Dublin after the Viking Settlement which formed the Base of their Power. Conung's Epithet is derived from old norse Konungr and simply means King. Some Scholars consider Amlaíb to be identical to olaf the White, a Viking Sea-King who features in the Landnámabók and other Icelandic Sagas."
