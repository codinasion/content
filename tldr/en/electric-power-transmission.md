title: "Electric power transmission"
short_summary: "Bulk movement of electrical energy"
description: "Electrical Power Transmission is the bulk Movement of electrical Energy from a Generator Site such as a Power Plant to an electrical Substation. The interconnected Lines that facilitate this Movement form a Transmission Network. This is distinct from local wiring between high-voltage Substations and Customers which is generally referred to as electric Power Distribution. The combined Transmission and Distribution Network is Part of the Electricity Grid known as the electrical Grid."
