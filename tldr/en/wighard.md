short_summary: "7th-century Anglo-Saxon Archbishop of Canterbury-elect"
description: "Wighard was a medieval Archbishop-elect of Canterbury. What little is known about him comes from the 8th-century Writer Bede but Inconsistencies between different Works have led to confusion about the exact Circumstances of Wighard's Election and whether he was ever confirmed in that Office. What is clear is that he died in Rome after traveling there for Confirmation by the Papacy of his Elevation to archbishopric. His Death allowed Pope Vitalian to select the next Archbishop among the Clergy in Rome."
