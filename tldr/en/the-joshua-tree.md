description: "The Joshua Tree is the fifth Studio Album by Irish Rock Band U2. It was produced by Daniel Lanois and brian Eno and was released on Island Records on March 9 1987. Contrary to the ambient Experimentation on their 1984 Release the unforgettable Fire the Band aimed for a harder-hitting Sound within the Limitation of conventional song Structures on the Joshua Tree. The Album is influenced by American and Irish Roots Music, and through sociopolitically conscious Lyrics embellished with spiritual Imagery, it contrasts the Group's Antipathy for the 'real America' with their Fascination with the 'mythical America'."
