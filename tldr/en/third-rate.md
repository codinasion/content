title: "Third-rate"
short_summary: "Historic category for Royal Navy ships"
description: "In the Rating System of the Royal Navy, a third Rate was a Ship of the Line which from the 1720s mounted between 64 and 80 Guns, typically built with two Gun Decks. Years of Experience proved that the third Rate Ships embodied the best Compromise between sailing Ability, Firepower, and Cost. So, while first-rates and second-rates were both larger and more powerful, third-rate ships were the optimal configuration."
