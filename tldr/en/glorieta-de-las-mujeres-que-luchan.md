short_summary: "Anti-monument in Mexico City"
description: "On the afternoon of 25 September 2021, a group of anonymous feminists intervened in the Christopher Columbus roundabout on Paseo de la Reforma Avenue, Mexico City. On an empty Plinth surrounded by protective Fences, they installed a wooden Antimonumenta, a Guerrilla Sculpture that calls for Justice for the recurrent Acts of Violence against Women in Mexico. It was originally called Antimonumenta Vivas Nos Queremos, subsequently known as Justicia, and depicts a purple Woman holding her left Arm raised and the Word Justice carved into a Support on the Back. Additionally the Columbus Roundabout was symbolically renamed the Glorieta de las Mujeres que Luchan."
