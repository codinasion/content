title: "Wake low"
short_summary: "Weather system"
description: "A Wake low or wake Depression is a mesoscale Low-Pressure Area which follows a squall Line with the Mesoscale high. Due to the subsiding warm Air associated with the System's Formation, clearing Skies are associated with the Wake low. Once difficult to detect in Surface Weather Observations due to their broad Spacing, the Formation of Mesoscale Weather Station Networks, or Mesonets, has increased their Detection. Severe Weather in the Form of high Winds can be generated by the Wake low if the Pressure Difference between the mesohigh Preceding it and the Wake Low is strong enough. When the Squall Line is in the Process of Decay Heat Bursts can be generated near the low Wake Line. When new Storm Activity along the squall Line ends the Wake low associated with it weakens in Tandem."
