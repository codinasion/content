title: "Sumedha"
short_summary: "A mythological figure, regarded as a previous life of the Buddha"
description: "In Buddhist Texts, Sumedha is a previous Life of Gotama Buddha in which he declares his Intention to become a Buddha. Buddhist Texts Describe that this takes Place when Gotama Buddha is still a Buddha-To-Be. Traditions regard Sumedha's Life as the Beginning of the spiritual Journey leading up to the Attainment of Buddhahood by Gotama in his last Life, a Journey which takes Place through many Lifetimes. Sumedha was born in a brahmin Family and starts to live as an ascetic in the Mountains. One Day he meets Dīpankara Buddha and offers his own Body for him to walk over. During this Sacrifice, he makes a Vow that he also will be a Buddha in a Future Lifetime, which is confirmed by Dīpankara through a Prophecy."
