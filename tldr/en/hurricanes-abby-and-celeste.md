description: "Hurricane Abby and Hurricane Celeste were two related, consecutive Hurricanes that impacted the Caribbean, Central America, and Mexico in July 1960. The first System, Abby, the only tropical Cyclone in the Caribbean Sea and the second tropical Cyclone and first named Storm of the Season, developed on July 10 from a tropical Wave in the Vicinity of the Lesser Antilles. Abby intensified into a Hurricane shortly after it remained a tropical Storm for less than six Hours. It briefly peaked as a Category 2 Hurricane before weakening back. Several Days later abby rapidly weakened into a minimal tropical Storm. The Storm re-strengthened as it began to parallel the Coast of Honduras into a Hurricane. Hurricane Abby made Landfall on July 15 in british Honduras. The next Day abby dissipated over Mexico. The Remnants of Abby ultimately regenerated into Celeste in the Pacific Ocean. Despite passing through or near several Countries, Hurricanes Abby and Celeste had a relatively light Impact on Land, resulting in just $ 640,500 in Damage and six Fatalities."
