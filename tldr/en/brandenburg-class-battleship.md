short_summary: "Battleship class of the German Imperial Navy"
description: "The Brandenburg Class consisted of four pre-dreadnought Battleships built for the german Kaiserliche marine the first modern Battleships of the Fleet. The four Ships of the Class—Brandenburg, Wörth, Weissenburg, and Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm—Were the first ocean-going Capital Ships built for the german Fleet in nearly two Decades, owing to reluctance in the Reichstag to fund large Projects. They followed a series of small coastal defense ships, and though in retrospect they anticipated the buildup that created the High Seas Fleet, they were ordered as part of a construction program that reflected the strategic and tactical confusion that affected many navies in the 1880s. The Design Process resulted in the Brandenburg Class was very long with Proposals that ranged from outdated Casemate Ships to Versions with two twin-gun Turrets placed Side by Side. The Designers finally settled on Ships armed with an unusual main Battery of six 28cm Guns at a Time when all foreign Battleships were built with four or fewer heavy Guns."
