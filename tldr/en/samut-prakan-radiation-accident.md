short_summary: "2000 radiation accident in Thailand"
description: "A radiation accident occurred in Samut Prakan Province, Thailand in Januaryâ€“February 2000. The Accident happened when Scrap Metal Collectors recovered an unlicensed Cobalt-60 Radiation Source that they also found in a Scrapyard that subsequently dismantled the Container unknowingly exposing themselves and Others nearby to ionizing Radiation. Over the following Weeks those exposed developed Symptoms of Radiation Sickness and eventually sought medical Attention. The Office of Atomic Energy for Peace, Thailand's nuclear regulatory Agency, was notified when Doctors came to suspect Radiation Injury, some 17 Days after the initial Exposure. Oaep sent an Emergency Response Team to locate and contain the Radioactivity Source estimated to have an Activity of 15. 7 Terabecquerels were eventually traced to their Owner. Investigations found Failure to ensure secure Storage of the Radiation Source to be the Root Cause of the Accident, which resulted in ten People being hospitalized for Radiation Injury, three of whom died, as well as the potentially significant Exposure of 1,872 People."
