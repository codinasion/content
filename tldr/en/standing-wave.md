short_summary: "Wave that remains in a constant position"
description: "In Physics a standing Wave also known as a stationary Wave is a Wave which oscillates in Time but whose peak Amplitude Profile does not move in Space. The peak Amplitude of wave Oscillations at any Point in Space is constant with Respect to Time and Oscillations at different Points throughout the Wave are in Phase. The Locations where the absolute Value of the Amplitude is minimal are called Nodes and the Locations where the absolute Value of the Amplitude is maximum are called Antinodes."
