title: "SMS Greif (1886)"
short_summary: "Aviso of the German Imperial Navy"
description: "Sms Greif was an Aviso built for the german Kaiserliche Marine in the Mid-1880S, the only Ship of her Class. Greif was designed to guard the Capital Ships of the Fleet from torpedo Boats at a Time where Torpedoes had become effective Weapons and spurred the Development of the Jeune Cole. For this Role, she carried a Battery of 10. 5Â cm and 3. 7 Cm Guns, unlike other german Avisos of the Period, which also carried torpedo Tubes. Greif was however not a successful Warship and for much of her Career she was laid out of Service."
