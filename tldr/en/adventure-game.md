short_summary: "Video game genre"
description: "An Adventure Game is a video Game Genre in which the Player assumes the Role of a Protagonist in an interactive Story, driven by Exploration and/or Puzzle-Solving. The Genre's Focus on Story allows it to draw heavily from other narrative-based Media such as Literature and Films that combine a wide Variety of Genres. Most adventure Games are designed for a single Player since the Focus on Story and Character makes multiplayer Design difficult. Colossal Cave Adventure is identified by Rick Adams as the first such Adventure Game, first released in 1976, while other notable Adventure Game Series include Zork, King's Quest, Monkey Island, Syberia, and Myst."
