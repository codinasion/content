description: "Megacephalosaurus is an extinct Genus of short-necked Pliosaur that lived in the western interior Seaway of north America during the turonian Stage of the late cretaceous containing the single Species m. Eulerti. It is named after its large Head, which is the largest of any Plesiosaur in the Continent and measures up to 1. 75 Meters in Length. Megacephalosaurus was one of the largest Marine Reptiles of its Time with an estimated Length of 69 Meters. Its long Snout and consistently sized teeth suggest that it preferred a Diet of smaller-sized Prey."
