short_summary: "Contested super-Earth orbiting Gliese 581"
description: "Gliese 581d is a doubtful and often disputed exoplanet Candidate that orbits within the gliese 581 System approximately 20. 4 light-years away in the Libra Constellation. It was the third Planet claimed in the System and the fourth or fifth in Order from the Star. Multiple subsequent Studies found that the planetary Signal in Fact Originates from stellar Activity, and thus the Planet does not exist, but this remains disputed."
