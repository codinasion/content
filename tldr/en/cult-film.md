short_summary: "Film that has acquired a cult following"
description: "A Cult Film or Cult Film commonly known as Cult Classic is a Film which has acquired a Cult following. Cult Films are known for their dedicated, Passionate Fanbase which forms an elaborate Subculture, Members of which Engage in repeated Viewings, Dialogue-Quoting, and Audience Participation. Inclusive Definitions allow major Studio Productions especially box-office Bombs while exclusive Definitions focus more on obscure transgressive Films shunned by the Mainstream. The Difficulty in defining the Term and Subjectivity of what qualifies as Cult Films mirror classificatory Disputes about Art. The Term Cult Film itself was used in the 1970s to describe the Culture that surrounded underground Films and Midnight Movies although Cult had been common Use in the Analysis of Films for Decades prior."
