short_summary: "Art movement"
description: "Pop Art is an art Movement that emerged during the Mid to late 50s in the united Kingdom and the united States. The Movement presented a Challenge to Traditions of fine Art by including Imagery from popular and mass Culture such as Advertising comic Books and mundane Mass produced Objects. One of its Aims is to use Images of popular Culture in Art emphasizing the Banal or kitschy Elements of any Culture most often through the Use of Irony. It is also associated with Artists' Use of mechanical Means of Reproduction or rendering Techniques. In pop Art, Material is sometimes visually removed from its known Context, isolated, or combined with unrelated Material."
