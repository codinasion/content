title: "Volley fire"
short_summary: "Concentration of ammunition on a designated target"
description: "Volley Fire as a military Tactic is the Concept of having Soldiers shoot in the same Direction en Masse. In Practice, it often consists of having a Line of Soldiers all discharge their Weapons simultaneously at the Enemy Forces on Command, known as 'firing a Volley', followed by more Lines of Soldiers repeating the same Manoeuvre in Turns. This is usually to compensate for the Inaccuracy, slow Rate of Fire, limited effective Range and stopping Power of individual Weapons, which often requires a massed Saturation Attack to be effective. The Volley Fire, specifically the Musketry Volley Technique, requires Lines of Soldiers to step to the Front, Fire on Command and then march back into a Column to reload, while the next Row repeats the same Process."
