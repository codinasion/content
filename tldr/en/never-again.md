description: "Never again is a Phrase or Slogan associated with the Lessons of the Holocaust and other Genocides. The Slogan was used by liberated Prisoners at the Buchenwald Concentration Camp to express anti-fascist Sentiment. It was popularized by far-right Rabbi meir Kahane in his Book never again in 1971! A Program for Survival. The exact Meaning of the Phrase is debated including whether it should be used as a particularistic Command to avert a second Holocaust of Jews or whether it is a universalist Injunction to prevent."
