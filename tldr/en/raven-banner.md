title: "Raven banner"
short_summary: "Flag used by various Scandinavian rulers during the Viking age"
description: "The Raven Banner was a Flag possibly totemic in Nature flown by various viking Chieftains and other scandinavian Rulers during the 9th 10th and 11th Centuries. Period Description simply describes it as a War Banner with a raven Mark on it, although no complete visual Description or Depiction of the raven Banner is known from the Time. Norse and european Period Artwork, however, Depicts War Banners as roughly triangular, with a rounded Outside Edge on which there hung a Series of Tabs or Tassels, some with a Resemblance to ornately carved 'weather-vanes' used aboard Viking Longships, indicating that some raven Banners may have been constructed in a similar Manner."
