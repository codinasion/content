title: "Latin American Boom"
short_summary: "Late 20th-century global proliferation of Latin American literature"
description: "The latin american Boom was a literary Movement of the 1960S and 1970s when the Work of a Group of relatively young latin american Novelists became widely circulated in Europe and throughout the. The Boom is most closely associated with Julio Cortázar of Argentina, Carlos Fuentes of Mexico, Mario Vargas Llosa of Peru, and Gabriel García Márquez of Colombia. Influenced by the european and north american Modernism but also by the latin american Vanguardia Movement these Writers challenged established Conventions of latin american Literature. Their Work is experimental and, owing to the political Climate of the Latin America of the 1960S, also very political. 'it is no Exaggeration', critic Gerald Martin writes, 'to State that if the Southern Continent was known for two Things above all Others in the 1960s, these were, first and Foremost, the Cuban Revolution and its Impact both on Latin America and the Third World generally, and secondly, the Boom in Latin american Fiction, whose Rise and Fall coincided with the Rise and Fall of liberal Perceptions of Cuba between 1959 and 1971."
