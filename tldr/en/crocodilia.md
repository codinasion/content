They first appeared 94 million Years ago in the Late Cretaceous Period and are the closest Living Relatives of Birds, as the two Groups are the only known Survivors of the Archosauria. Members of the Order's total Group the Clade Pseudosuchia appeared in the early triassic Period around 250 million Years ago and diversified during the Mesozoic Era.
