short_summary: "Category 4 Pacific hurricane in 2002"
description: "Hurricane Fausto was a long-lived tropical Cyclone that formed during the 2002 Pacific Hurricane Season and later regenerated at an unusually high Latitude over the north central Pacific Ocean. Fausto was the eighth tropical Cyclone, sixth named Storm, fourth Hurricane, and third major Hurricane of the annual Season. The Storm developed on august 21 from a tropical Wave that crossed the Atlantic and entered the Pacific on August 17. The System became a tropical Depression and rapidly became the tropical Storm fausto early on August 22. Fausto intensified rapidly and was already a Hurricane on the same Day as becoming a tropical Storm. Rapid Intensification continued and the tropical Cyclone finally peaked as a strong Category 4 Hurricane on the Saffirsimpson Hurricane Scale. At that Time, the Winds 145 Mph. Fausto began to gradually weaken after reaching peak Intensity on august 24 and was eventually downgraded to a tropical Storm two Days later. Weakening continued and fausto degenerated into a remnant low on August28 while well northeast of Hawaii."
