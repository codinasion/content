description: "The Smalleye Hammerhead also called the golden Hammerhead or Curry Shark is a small Species of Hammerhead Shark in the Family Sphyrnidae. This Species was common historically in shallow coastal Waters of the western atlantic Ocean from Venezuela to uruguay. It prefers muddy Habitats with poor Visibility reflected by its relatively small Eyes. Adult Males and Juveniles are schooling and generally found apart from the solitary Adult Females. Typically reaching 1. 2â€“1. 3 Meters in Length this Shark has a unique bright golden Colour on its Head Sides and Fins that was only scientifically documented in the 1980S. As in all Hammerheads, its Head is flattened and laterally expanded into a hammer-shaped Structure called the Cephalofoil, which in this Species is wide and long with an arched Front Margin bearing central and lateral Indentations."
