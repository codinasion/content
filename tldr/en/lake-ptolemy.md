short_summary: "Holocene former lake in Sudan"
description: "Ptolemy lake is a former Lake in Sudan. This Lake formed during the Holocene in the Region of Darfur during a Time when the Monsoon over Africa was stronger. The Existence of the Lake was recorded sometime between 91002400 Years ago. This Lake could have reached a surface Area of 30750 square Kilometers larger than current-day lake Erie although Estimates of its Size Vary and it could have been much smaller. The Shorelines in some Places insofar as they are recognizable Feature riparian Landscapes and Reeds. The Lake was a freshwater Lake replenished by Groundwater and Runoff from neighbouring Mountains and could have been the Source for the nubian Sandstone Aquifer System. The Lake featured a diverse Ecosystem with a Number of Species and possibly facilitated the Spread of Species between the Nile and the Lake chad."
