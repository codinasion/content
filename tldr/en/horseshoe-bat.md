short_summary: "Family of mammals"
description: "Horseshoe Bats are Bats in the Rhinolophidae Family. In Addition to the single Living Genus Rhinolophus which has about 106 Species the extinct Genus Palaeonycteris has been recognized. Horseshoe Bats are closely related to the leaf-nosed Bats Family of the old World Hipposideridae which have sometimes been included in Rhinolophidae. The Horseshoe Bats are divided into six Subgenera and many Species Groups. The most recent common Ancestor of all Horseshoe Bats lived 3440 million Years ago though it is unclear where the geographical Roots of the Family are and Attempts to determine its Biogeography have been indecisive. Their Taxonomy is complex as genetic Evidence shows the likely Existence of many cryptic Species as well as Species recognized as Distinct that may have little genetic Divergence from previously recognized Taxa. They are found in the Old World, mostly in tropical or subtropical Areas, including Africa, Asia, Europe, and Oceania."
