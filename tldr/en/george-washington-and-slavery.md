short_summary: "George Washington's relationship with slavery"
description: "The history of George Washington and slavery reflects Washington's changing attitude toward the ownership of human beings. The Preeminent founding Father of the United States and a hereditary Slaveowner, Washington became increasingly uneasy with it. Slavery was then a longstanding Institution dating back over a Century in Virginia where he lived ; it was also longstanding in other american Colonies and in World History. Washington's will immediately freed one of his Slaves, and required his remaining 123 Slaves to serve his Wife and be freed no later than her Death, so they ultimately became free one Year after his own Death."
