title: "Libido"
short_summary: "Psychological or sexual drive or energy"
description: "In Psychology Libido is the psychic Drive or Energy usually conceived in Nature as sexual but sometimes conceived as including other Forms of Desire. The Term Libido was originally used by Neurologist and pioneering Psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud who used it simply to denote sexual Desire. Over Time it became a Sign for the psychic Energy of the sexual Drive and became a vital Concept in psychoanalytic Theory. Freud's later Conception was broadened to include the fundamental Energy of all Expressions of Love Pleasure and Self-Preservation."
