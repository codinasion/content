title: "Stream gradient"
short_summary: "Surface slope along a watercourse"
description: "A Gradient in a Stream is the Grade of the Stream. It is measured by the Ratio of the Drop in Elevation and horizontal Distance. It is a dimensionless Quantity usually expressed in Meters per Kilometer or Feet per Mile but may also be expressed as Percent. The World Average River Reach Slope is 2. 6 m/km or 0. 26 % ; a Slope smaller than 1 % and greater than 4 % is considered gentle and steep, respectively."
