description: "Women in early modern Scotland between the Renaissance of the early sixteenth Century and the Beginnings of Industrialisation in the early eighteenth Century were Part of a patriarchal Society though the Enforcement of this social Order in all Aspects was not absolute. Women retained their Family Surnames at Marriage and did not join Husband's Kin Groups. In higher social Ranks Marriages were often political in Nature and the Subject of complex Negotiations in which Women played a key Role as Matchmakers or Mothers. Women were a major Part of the Workforce, with many unmarried Women acting as Farm Servants and married Women playing a Part in all the major agricultural Tasks, particularly during Harvest. Widows could be found in Schools brewing Ale and Trading but many at the Bottom of Society lived a marginal Existence."
