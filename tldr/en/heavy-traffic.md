short_summary: "1973 film by Ralph Bakshi"
description: "Heavy Traffic is a 1973 american Live-Action animated Drama Film written and directed by Ralph Bakshi. The Film which begins and sometimes Combines with Live-Action explores the often surreal Fantasies of a young new York City Cartoonist called Michael Corleone using pinball Imagery as a Metaphor for inner-city Life. Heavy Traffic was Bakshi's Follow-Up to the Fritz the Cat Film by Producer Steve Krantz. Although Producer Krantz made varied Attempts to produce an r-rated Film heavy Traffic was given an X Rating by the Mpaa. The Film received largely positive Reviews and is widely considered to be Bakshi's biggest critical Success."
