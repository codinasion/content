description: "Love is blindness is a Song by Rock Band U2 and the 12th and final Track on their 1991 Album Achtung Baby. The Song was written on Piano by lead Singer Bono during the Recording Sessions for U2's album Rattle and Hum in 1988. The Band originally intended to give the Song to singer nina Simone but after playing together decided to keep it for Achtung Baby. Thematically the Song describes a failing Romance mixing personal Themes with metaphorical Acts of Terrorism. During recording Sessions for the Guitarist Achtung Baby Edge separated from his Wife Aislinn O'Sullivan. The Separation had a major Effect on the Development of the Song Bono said that the ending Guitar Solo was a cathartic Experience for Edge as he snapped several guitar Strings during the Recording."
