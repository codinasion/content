short_summary: "Category 3 South Pacific severe tropical cyclone in 1997"
description: "In March 1997 severe tropical Cyclone Hina was the worst Cyclone to affect the south pacific Island Nation of Tonga since Cyclone Isaac in 1982. The System was first noted within the Monsoon Trough on 11 March 1997 as a weak shallow Depression in the Vicinity of Rotuma. Over the next two Days the Depression remained near Rotuma with no preferred Movement as it started to develop further within favorable Conditions for further Development. The System was later named Hina on 15 March after it started to move Eastwards and passed Southeast of niulakita Tuvalu. During that Day the System moved south-east and impacted Wallis and Futuna before it passed through the southern Islands of Tongatapu and Eua during March 16th and. After impacting tonga the System moved rapidly towards South-Southeast and weakened below the tropical Cyclone Intensity before being last noted about 1500km to the South of the Pitcairn Islands on March 21. During the System's Post-Analysis it was determined that warning Centers underestimated Hina's Intensity as it passed over Tonga after Damage in the Island Nation had been greater than expected."
