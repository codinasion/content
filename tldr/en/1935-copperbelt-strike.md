short_summary: "Mineworkers' strike in Northern Rhodesia"
description: "A major Strike of african Mineworkers broke out on 29 may 1935 in the Copperbelt Province of northern Rhodesia in Protest over Taxes levied by the british. The Strike involved three of the Province's four major Copper Mines: those in Mufulira, Nkana and Roan Antelope. Six Protesters were killed by Police near the Latter and the Strike was ended. Although it failed the Strike was the first organized industrial Agitation in northern Rhodesia and is viewed by some as the first overt Action against Colonial Rule. It caught the Attention of a Number of african Townsmen leading to the Creation of Trade Unions and african Nationalist Politics and is considered as the Birth of african Nationalism."
