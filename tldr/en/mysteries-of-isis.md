title: "Mysteries of Isis"
short_summary: "Religious rites in the Greco-Roman cult of Isis"
description: "The Mysteries of Isis were religious Initiation Rites performed in the greek World in the Cult of the egyptian Goddess Isis. They were modeled on other Mystery Rites especially eleusinian Mysteries in Honor of greek Goddesses Demeter and Persephone and started sometime between the third Century Bce and the second Century Ce. Despite their mainly hellenistic origins the Mysteries alluded to beliefs from ancient egyptian Religion in which the Worship of Isis emerged and may have incorporated Aspects of egyptian ritual. Although Isis was worshipped in many Parts of the greco-roman World the Mysteries Rites are only known to have been practiced in a few Regions. In Areas where they were practiced they served to strengthen Devotees' Commitment to the Isis Cult although they were not required to worship her exclusively and Devotees may have rose by Initiation into the Cult Hierarchy. The Rites may also have been thought to guarantee that the Initiate's Soul would continue into a blissful Afterlife with the Help of the Goddess."
