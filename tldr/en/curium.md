short_summary: "Chemical element, symbol Cm and atomic number 96"
description: "Curium is a synthetic Chemical Element having a Symbol Cm and an atomic Number 96. This transuranic Actinide Element was named after the famous Scientists Marie and pierre Curie who were known for their Research on Radioactivity. Curium was first intentionally made by the Team of Glenn T. Seaborg, Ralph A. James and albert Ghiorso using the Cyclotron at Berkeley in 1944. They bombarded the newly discovered element plutonium with alpha particles. It then went to the metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago where a small Sample of Curium was finally separated and identified. The discovery was kept secret until after the end of World War II. The News was released to the Public in november 1947. Most Curium is produced by bombarding Uranium or Plutonium in nuclear Reactors with Neutrons one Tonne of spent nuclear Fuel contains 20 Grams of Cu."
