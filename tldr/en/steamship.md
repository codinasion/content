short_summary: "Type of steam-powered vessel"
description: "A Steamship commonly referred to as a Steamer is a Type of steam-powered Vessel generally seaworthy and ocean-faring which is propelled by one or more Steam Engines which typically move Propellers or Paddlewheels. The first Steamships came into practical Use in the early 1800s however there were some Exceptions before. Steamships usually use the Prefix Designations ps for a paddle Steamer or Ss for a Screw Steamer. As paddle Steamers became less common Ss is assumed by many to stand for Steamship. Ships powered by Combustion Engines use a Prefix such as Mv for Motor Vessels so it is not correct to use Ss for most modern Vessels."
