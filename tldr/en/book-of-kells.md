short_summary: "Illuminated 9th-century Gospel book"
description: "The Book of Kells is an illuminated Manuscript and Celtic Gospel Book in Latin, containing the four Gospels of the New Testament together with various Prefatory Texts and Tables. It was created in a columban Monastery in either Ireland or Scotland and may have had Contributions from various columban Institutions from each of these Areas. It is believed to have been created C. 800 AD. The Gospels' Text is largely drawn from the Vulgate although it also includes several Passages drawn from the earlier Versions known as Vetus Latina. It is regarded as a masterwork of Western calligraphy and the pinnacle of Insular illumination. The Manuscript takes its Name from the Abbey of Kells county Meath which served as its Home for Centuries."
