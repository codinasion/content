Initially meant to be produced by South Sea Film and shot by an american Director, the Film – which follows a Woman told to marry a Man she does not love – was ultimately completed by Wong's Halimoen Film. Details on its Cast and Performance are contradictory although the Film is recognised as the first of a long Series of ethnic Chinese produced Films in the Country. It's probably a lost Film."
