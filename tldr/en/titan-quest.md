A mobile Port was developed and published by Dotemu in 2016 and Versions for the Playstation 4 Xbox one and nintendo Switch were released in 2018. All these Versions were published by Thq Nordic. The Story follows a player-created Protagonist as they navigate ancient Egypt and China on a Quest to defeat the Titans after they escape from their Ancient Prison. The Gameplay is similar to the Diablo Series with Player Navigation handled with a mouse-driven tile-based Interface and gaming revolving around role-playing Mechanics and real-time Combat. Quest immortal Throne had four Expansions created in 2007 and three more between 2017 and 2021."
