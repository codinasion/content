description: "Northern lites is the ninth single from super Furry Animals. It was the first single to be taken from the Guerrilla Album and reached Number 11 in the Uk Singles Chart after its Release on 10 May 1999. The Song was written by Singer Gruff Rhys and was inspired by El Nio. The Title of the Track Refers to the Aurora borealis a natural Light Display which the Band were convinced they had seen before the Song was written. Rhys wrote the Melody for northern lites several Years before it was completed but only decided a Calypso Style when he wrote the Lyrics. The Steel Drums on the Track are played by Keyboardist Cian Ciaran and were added on the Spur of the Moment after the Group saw them 'lying around' real World Studios during recording."
