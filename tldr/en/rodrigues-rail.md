description: "The Rodrigues rail also known as the Leguat's Gelinote or Leguat's Rail is an extinct Species of the Rail Family that was endemic to the Mascarene Island of Rodrigues. The Bird was first documented from Life by two Accounts from 169193 and 172526. Subfossil Remains were later discovered and correlated in 1874 with the old Accounts and the Species was named E. Leguati in Leguat's Honour. It is generally kept in its own Genus, Erythromachus, but has sometimes been assigned to the Genus Aphanapteryx along with its close relative the red Rail of Mauritius ; their Relationship with other Rails is unclear."
