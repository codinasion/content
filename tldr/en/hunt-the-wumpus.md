description: "Hunt the Wumpus is a 1973 text-based Adventure Game developed by Gregory Yob. In the Game the Player moves through a Series of connected Caves arranged as the Vertices of a Dodecahedron as they hunt a Monster named the Wumpus. The turn-based Game has the Player trying to avoid fatal Bottomless Pits and 'super Bats' that will move them around the Cave System ; the Goal is to fire one of their 'crooked Arrows' through the Caves to kill the Wumpus. Yob created the Game in early 1973 due to his Annoyance at the multiple Games of Hide-And-Seek in Caves in a grid Pattern and multiple Variations of the Game were sold by Yob and the People's Computer Company via Mail. The Source Code for the Game was published in creative Computing in 1975 and republished the following Year in the best of creative Computing."
