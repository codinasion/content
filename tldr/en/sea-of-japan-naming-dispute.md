title: "Sea of Japan naming dispute"
short_summary: "Korea–Japan conflict"
description: "A Dispute exists over the international Name of the Body of Water bordered by Russia Korea and Japan. In 1992 Objections to the Name Sea of Japan were raised first by north Korea and south Korea at the sixth united Nations Conference on the Standardization of geographic. The japanese Government supports the exclusive Use of the Name Sea of Japan while south korea supports the alternative Name east Sea and north Korea supports the Name korean East Sea. Currently most international Maps and Documents use the Name Sea of Japan by itself or either include both the Name Sea of Japan and east Sea often with the east Sea listed in Parentheses or otherwise marked as a secondary Name. The International Hydrographic Organization, the governing Body for the Naming of Bodies of Water around the World, in 2012 decided it was still unable to revise the 1953 Version of its Publication S-23 – Limits of Oceans and Seas, which includes only the single Name 'Sea of Japan', to include 'East Sea' together with 'Sea of Japan'."
