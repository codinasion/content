short_summary: "Overview of use of mythology in Carnivàle"
description: "Carnivle is an american Tv Series set during the great Depression in the united States. The Series traces the disparate Storylines of a young Carnival Worker named Ben Hawkins and Brother Justin Crowe, a Preacher in California. The overarching Story is built around a good and evil Theme which serves as a human-scaled Metaphor within a complex Structure of Myth and Allegory. Samson, the Carnival's Dwarf Manager, sets up the Show's Mythology with a Prologue in the Pilot Episode, talking of 'a Creature of Light and a Creature of Darkness' being born 'to each Generation' preparing for a final Battle."
