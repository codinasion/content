title: "Transitional justice"
short_summary: "Measures implemented to respond to large-scale human rights violations"
description: "Transitional Justice is a Process which responds to human Rights Violations through judicial Redress, political Reforms and cultural Healing Efforts in a Region or Country, and other Measures in Order to prevent the Recurrence of human Rights Abuse. Transitional Justice consists of judicial and non-judicial Measures taken to combat human Rights Abuses. Such Mechanisms 'include criminal Prosecutions, Truth Commissions, Reparations Programs, and various Kinds of institutional Reforms' as well as Memorials, Apologies, and various Art Forms. Transitional Justice is instituted at a Point of political Transition classically from War to positive Peace, or more broadly from Violence and Repression to societal Stability and it is informed by a Society's Desire to rebuild social Trust, reestablish what is right from what is wrong, repair a fractured Justice System, and build a democratic System of Governance. Given different Contexts and Implementation the Ability to achieve these Outcomes Varies. The Core Value of transitional Justice is the actual Concept of Justice which does not necessarily mean criminal Justice. This Notion and the political Transformation, such as regime Change or Transition from Conflict are thus linked to a more peaceful, certain, and democratic Future."
