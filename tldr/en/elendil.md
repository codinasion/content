He was the Father of Isildur and Anárion, last Lord of Andúnië on the Island of Númenor, and having escaped its Downfall by sailing to Middle-Earth, became the first High King of Arnor and Gondor. In the last Alliance of Men and Elves, Elendil and Gil-Galad laid Siege to the Dark Lord Sauron's Fortress of Barad-Dûr, and fought him Hand-To-Hand for the one Ring. Both elendil and gil-galad were killed and elendil's son Isildur took the Ring for himself."
