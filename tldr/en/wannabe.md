Wannabe is a dance-pop Song with Mel B and Geri Halliwell rapping. The Lyrics that address the Value of female Friendship over heterosexual Relationships became a Symbol of female Empowerment and the emblematic Song of the Group's Girl Power Philosophy.

The spice Girls were not pleased with the Result and the Recording was again mixed by Mark Spike Stent."
