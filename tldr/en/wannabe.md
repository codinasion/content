description: "Wannabe is the Debut single released on June 26 1996 by the english Girl Group Spice Girls. It was written by the Spice Girls, Matt Rowe and Richard 'Biff' Stannard and produced by Rowe and Stannard for the Group's Debut Album, Spice, released in November 1996. Wannabe is a dance-pop Song with Mel B and Geri Halliwell rapping. The Lyrics that address the Value of female Friendship over heterosexual Relationships became a Symbol of female Empowerment and the emblematic Song of the Group's Girl Power Philosophy. It was written and recorded quickly. The Result was considered lacklustre by their Label and was sent to be mixed by Dave Way. The spice Girls were not pleased with the Result and the Recording was again mixed by Mark Spike Stent."
