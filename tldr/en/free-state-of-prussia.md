The Successor to the Kingdom of Prussia after the Defeat of the german Empire in World War I it continued to be the dominant State in Germany during the Weimar Republic as it had been during the Empire even though most of Germany's post-war territorial Losses in Europe came from. It was home to the federal Capital Berlin and had 62 % of Germany's Territory and 61 % of its Population. Prussia changed from the authoritarian State it had been in the past and became a parliamentary Democracy under its Constitution in 1920. During the weimar Period it was almost entirely governed by pro-democratic Parties and proved more politically stable than the republic itself. With only brief Interruptions, the Social Democratic Party provided the Minister President. The Spd's interior Ministers also pushed republican Reform of Administration and Police with the Result that Prussia was considered a Bulwark of Democracy within the Weimar Republic."
