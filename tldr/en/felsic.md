title: "Felsic"
short_summary: "Igneous rock rich in silica and feldspar"
description: "In Geology Felsic is a Modifier which describes igneous Rocks that are relatively rich in Elements that form Feldspar and Quartz. It is contrasted with Mafic Rocks which are relatively richer in Magnesium and Iron. Felsic Refers to silicate Minerals, Magma, and Rocks which are enriched in the lighter Elements such as Silicon, Oxygen, Aluminium, Sodium, and Potassium. Felsic Magma or Lava is higher in Viscosity than mafic Magma/Lava, and have low Temperatures to keep the felsic Minerals molten."
