short_summary: "Type of weather with lightning and thunder"
description: "A Thunderstorm also known as an electrical Storm or a lightning Storm is a Storm characterized by the Presence of Lightning and its acoustic Effect on the Earth's atmosphere known as Thunder. Relatively weak Thunderstorms are sometimes called Thundershowers. Thunderstorms happen in a Type of Cloud known as Cumulonimbus. They are usually accompanied by strong Winds and often produce heavy Rain and sometimes snow Sleet or Hail but some Thunderstorms produce little or no Precipitation at all. Thunderstorms can form in a Series or become a Rainband known as Squall Line. Strong or severe Thunderstorms include some of the most dangerous Weather Conditions including large Hail strong Winds and Tornadoes. Some of the most persistent severe Thunderstorms known as Supercells rotate as Do Cyclones. While most Thunderstorms move with the Mean Wind Flow through the Layer of the Troposphere that they occupy vertical Wind Shear sometimes causes a Deviation in their Course at a right Angle to the Wind shear Direction."
