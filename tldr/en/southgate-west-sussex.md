description: "Southgate is one of the 14 residential Neighbourhoods in Crawley, a Town and Borough in West Sussex, England. After the second World War Crawley was planned and laid out as a new City based on the Principle of self-contained Neighbourhoods around a City Centre of Civic and commercial Buildings. Southgate was one of the four in the inner Circle Closest to the Centre and was intended to be the largest of the nine designed in the original Master Plan. It was built in two Stages between the 1950s and the 1970s, but retains some older Buildings from before the New Town Era and has 'significant Areas of pre-new Town Character'."
