title: "Cop-win graph"
short_summary: "Type of graph related to pursuitâ€“evasion"
description: "In Graph Theory a cop-win Graph is an undirected Graph on which the Chaser can always win a Pursuitevasion Game against a Robber with the Players taking alternating Turns in which they can choose to move along an Edge of a Graph or stay put until the Cop Lands. Finite cop-win Graphs are also known as dismantlable Graphs or constructible Graphs because they can be dismantled by repeatedly removing a dominating Vertex or constructed by repeatedly adding such. The cop-win Graphs can be recognised in polynomial Time by a Greedy Algorithm that creates a Dismantling Order. They include chordal Graphs and Graphs that contain a universal Vertex."
