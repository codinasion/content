short_summary: "Former medieval lordship in Wales"
description: "The three Castles was a former Medieval Lordship containing the Fortifications of Grosmont Skenfrith and white Castle in Monmouthshire Wales. The Castles were built by Normans to protect the Route from Wales to hereford in the Wake of their Conquest of England in 1066. Possibly commissioned by William Fitz Osbern, the Earl of Hereford, they initially comprised earthwork Fortifications with Timber Defences. In 1135 a major Welsh Revolt took Place and in Response King Stephen brought together the Castles to form the Lordship which continued to play a Role in the Defence of the Region for several Centuries."
