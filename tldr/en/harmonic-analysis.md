title: "Harmonic analysis"
short_summary: "Study of superpositions in mathematics"
description: "Harmonic Analysis is a Branch of Mathematics concerned with investigating the Connections between a Function and its Representation in Frequency. The Frequency Representation can be found by using the Fourier Transform for Functions on the real Line or the fourier Series for periodic Functions. Generalizing these Transforms to other Domains is generally referred to as fourier Analysis although the Term is often interchangeably used with harmonic Analysis. Harmonic Analysis has become a vast Subject with Applications in Areas such as Number Theory Representation theory signal Processing Quantum Mechanics tidal Analysis and Neuroscience."
