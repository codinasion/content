title: "Eric Easton"
short_summary: "British music manager (1927–1995)"
description: "Eric Easton was an english Record Producer and the first Manager of British Rock Group the Rolling Stones. He grew up in Lancashire and became involved in the Music Industry playing the Organ in Music Halls and Cinemas. In the 1960S he had moved into Management and Talent spotting operating from a london Office in regent Street. Easton met Andrew Loog Oldham in 1963 ; Oldham wanted to sign an unknown Band, called the Rolling Stones, about whom he was enthusiastic. The Band was still playing small Clubs and Blues Bars at the Time. Easton saw them once—at the Crawdaddy Club in Richmond—And agreed with Oldham. Their Partnership was one of Contrasts: Oldham has been described as bringing Youth and Energy, while Easton brought Industry Experience, Contacts and Financing. Together they signed the Group to both a Management and Publishing Deal which while giving better Terms for the Group than the Beatles received was to the Advantage of Easton and Oldham who received a larger Cut. Easton was primarily responsible for booking Gigs—He was keen for the Group to get out of London and play Nationally—But also acted as Record Producer on a Number of Occasions, including on their first single, a cover Version of Chuck Berry's 'Come on' in June 1963. Easton was responsible for many Aspects of the Band's Development from the Management of their Fan Club to organising their 1964 Tour of America."
