short_summary: "Element in a figure skating competition"
description: "Compulsory Figures or School Figures were formerly a Part of Figure Skating and gave the Sport its Name. They are circular Patterns that Skaters trace on the Ice to demonstrate their Ability to place clean Turns evenly on Round Circles. For approximately the first 50 Years of Figure Skating as a Sport until 1947 Compulsory Figures made up 60 Percent of the total Score at most Contests around the World. These Figures continued to dominate the Sport although they steadily decreased in Importance until the international Skating Union voted in 1990 to discontinue them as Part of Competitions. Learning and Training in Compulsory Figures instilled Discipline and Control ; some in the Figure skating Community considered them necessary to teach Skaters basic Skills. Skaters would train for Hours to learn and execute them well, and competing and Judging Figures would often take up to eight Hours during Competitions."
