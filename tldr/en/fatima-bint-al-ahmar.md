title: "Fatima bint al-Ahmar"
short_summary: "Nasrid Princess"
description: "Fatima Bint Muhammad Bint Al-Ahmar was a Nasrid Princess of the Emirate of Granada, the last Muslim State on the iberian Peninsula. A Daughter of Sultan Muhammad Ii and an Expert in the Study of Barnamaj, she married her Father's Cousin and trusted ally, Abu Said Faraj. Their Son Ismail I was sultan after deposing her Half-Brother Nasr. She was involved in the Government of her Son but was especially politically active during the Rule of her Grandsons, Muhammad Iv and Yusuf i, both of whom ascended the Throne at a young Age and were placed under her Tutelage. Later Granadan historian Ibn al-khatib wrote an Elegy for her Death Stating that 'she was alone, surpassing the Women of her Time / like the Night of Power surpasses all the other Nights'. Modern historian María Jesús Rubiera Mata compared her Role to that of María de Molina, her contemporary who became Regent to castilian Kings. Professor Brian A. Catlos attributed the Survival of the Dynasty and eventual Success partly to her Vision and Constancy."
