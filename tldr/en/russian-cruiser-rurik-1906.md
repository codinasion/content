short_summary: "Armored cruiser of the Russian Imperial Navy"
description: "Rurik was the last armored Cruiser built for the russian imperial Navy. The Ship was designed by the british Firm Vickers and built in their Shipyard, being laid down in 1905 and completed in 1908. She was armed with a main Battery of four 254mm Guns and a secondary Battery of eight 203mm Guns her top Speed was rated at 21 Knots. Despite her powerful gun Armour Rurik was rendered obsolescent even before the Advent of the british Battlecruisers of the invincible Class which were faster and more powerfully armed. Her Design is nevertheless well-regarded and naval Historians Rate her as one of the best Vessels of her Type ever built."
