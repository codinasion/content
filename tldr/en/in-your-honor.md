description: "In your Honor is the fifth Studio Album by american Rock Band Foo Fighters, released on June 14, 2005, through Roswell and Rca Records. It is a double Album, with the first Disc containing heavy Rock Songs and the second containing Mellower acoustic Songs. Dave Grohl decided to make a diverse Mix of Songs as he felt the Band had to break new Ground after ten Years of Existence. The Album was recorded at a newly built Studio in Northridge, Los Angeles, and Features Guests such as John Paul Jones, Norah Jones, and Josh Homme. Its Lyrics are both resonant and introspective Themes with a major Influence from Grohl's Involvement on the Campaign Trail with John Kerry during the 2004 presidential Election. It was the first Album featuring Keyboardist Rami Jaffee although he did n't join the Band as a full-time Member until 2017."
