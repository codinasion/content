title: "Depositional environment"
short_summary: "Processes associated with the deposition of a particular type of sediment"
description: "In geology depositional Environment or sedimentary Environment describes the Combination of physical Chemical and biological Processes associated with the Deposition of a specific Type of Sediment and therefore the Rock Types that will be formed after Lithification if the Sediment is preserved in the Rock Record. In most Cases the Environments associated with particular Rock Types or Associations of Rock Types can be matched to existing Analogs. However, the further back in geological Time Sediments were deposited, the more likely that direct modern Analogues are not available."
