title: "Outflow boundary"
short_summary: "Mesoscale boundary separating outflow from the surrounding air"
description: "An outflow Boundary also known as a Gust Front is a storm-scale or mesoscale Boundary that separates thunderstorm-cooled Air from the surrounding Air similar in Effect to a cold Front but marked by a Wind Shift and usually a Drop in Temperature and a related Pressure Jump. Outflow Boundaries can persist for 24 Hours or more after Thunderstorms that created them Dissipate and can travel Hundreds of Kilometers from their origin Region. New Thunderstorms often develop along the outflow Boundaries especially near the Intersection of another Boundary. Outflow Boundaries can be seen on Weather Radar Imagery either as thin Lines or as Arcs of low Clouds on Weather Satellite Imagery. From the Ground, outflow Boundaries can be co-located with the Appearance of Roll Clouds and Shelf Clouds."
