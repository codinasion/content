description: "The Rhodes Piano is an electric Piano invented by Harold Rhodes that became popular in the 1970S. Like a conventional Piano, the Rhodes Generates sound with Keys and Hammers, but instead of Strings, the Hammers Strike thin Metal Tines, which vibrate next to an electromagnetic Pickup making it essentially an Electric Dulcitone. The Signal is then sent through a Cable to an external Amplifier and Speaker for the Keyboard."
