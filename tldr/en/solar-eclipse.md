title: "Solar eclipse"
short_summary: "Natural phenomenon wherein the Sun is obscured by the Moon"
description: "A solar Eclipse occurs when the Moon Passes between Earth and the Sun thereby completely or partially blocking the View of the Sun from a small Part of the Earth. Such an alignment occurs approximately every six months, during the eclipse season in its new moon phase, when the Moon's orbital plane is closest to the plane of the Earth's orbit. In a total Eclipse the Sun's Disk is completely obscured by the Moon. In partial and annular Eclipses only a small Portion of the Sun is obscured. A solar Eclipse can only be viewed from a relatively small Area of the World compared to a Lunar Eclipse which can be seen from anywhere on the Night Side of Earth. As such although total solar Eclipses occur somewhere on Earth every 18 Months on Average they recur only once every 360 to 410 Years at any given Place."
