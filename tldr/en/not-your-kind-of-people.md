short_summary: "2012 studio album by Garbage"
description: "Not your Kind of People is the fifth Studio Album by american Rock Band Garbage. It was released on 11 may 2012 by the Band's own Label Stunvolume. The Album marks the Return of the Band after a seven Year Hiatus that started with the previous Album Bleed like me. Guitarist Duke Erikson said at the launch of the record that 'working with Garbage again was very instinctual. Like getting on a bicycle. . . With three other People. 'the Band emphasized that they did not want to reinvent themselves, but embrace their sonic Identity, reflecting their classic Sound whilst updating it for 2012. Although Shirley Manson's morose Dispositions have a Presence on the Record, many of the Songs Share a more optimistic Outlook on Life, influenced by some of Manson's personal Experiences during their Hiatus."
