title: "Senate of the Roman Republic"
short_summary: "Governing and advisory assembly of the aristocracy"
description: "The Senate was the Governing and advisory Body of the Aristocracy in the ancient Roman Republic. It was not an elected Body but one whose Members were appointed by the Consuls and later by the Censors appointed by the aristocratic Centuriate Assembly. After a Roman Magistrate served his Term in Office it usually was followed by automatic Appointment to the Senate. According to the greek historian Polybius, the principal Source on the Constitution of the Roman Republic, the Roman Senate was the predominant Branch of Government. Polybius noted that it was the Consuls who lead the Armies and civil Government in Rome and that it was the roman Assemblies who had the ultimate Authority over Elections Legislation and criminal Trials. However, since the Senate controlled Money, Administration, and the Details of foreign Policy, it had the most Control over day-to-day Life. The Power and Authority of the Senate derived from Precedent, the high Caliber and Prestige of the Senators, and the Senate's unbroken Lineage, which dated back to the Founding of the Republic in 509 Bc. It developed from the Senate of the Roman Kingdom, and became the Senate of the Roman Empire."
