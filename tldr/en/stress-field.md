title: "Stress field"
short_summary: "Distribution of internal forces in a body that balance a given set of external forces"
description: "A stress Field is the Distribution of internal Forces in a Body that Balance a given Set of external Forces. Stress Fields are widely used in Fluid Dynamics and Materials Science. Consider that one can picture the Stress Fields as the Stress created by adding another half Plane of Atoms to a Crystal. The Bonds are clearly stretched around the Location of the Dislocation and this Stretching causes the stress Field to form. Atomic Bonds farther away from the Dislocation Center are less and less stretched this is why the Stress Field dissipates as the Distance from the Dislocation Center Increases. Each Dislocation within the Material has an associated Stress Field. The Creation of these Stress Fields is the Result of the Material trying to dissipate mechanical Energy exerted on the Material. By Convention these Dislocations are labelled as either positive or negative depending on whether the stress Field of the Dislocation is mostly compressive or Tensile."
