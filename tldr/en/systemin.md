title: "Systemin"
short_summary: "Plant peptide hormone"
description: "Systemin is a Plant peptide Hormone involved in the Wound Response in the Solanaceae Family. It was the first Plant Hormone that was shown to be a peptide having been isolated from tomato Leaves in 1991 by a Group led by Clarence a. Ryan. Since then, other Peptides with similar Functions have been identified in Tomato and Outside of the Solanaceae. Hydroproline-rich Glycopeptides were found in Tobacco in 2001 and Atpeps were found in Arabidopsis Thaliana in 2006. Their Precursors are found in the Cytoplasm and Cell Walls of Plant Cells but upon insect Damage Precursors are processed to produce one or more Mature Peptides. The Receptor for Systemin was originally believed to be the same as the Receptor for Brassinolide but the latter is now uncertain. The signal Transduction processes that Occur after the Peptides Bind are similar to cytokine-mediated Inflammatory immune Responses in Animals. Early Experiments showed that Systemin travelled around the Plant after Insects had damaged the Plant, activating systemic acquired Resistance, now it is thought that it increases the Production of jasmonic Acid causing the same Result. Systemins are mainly responsible for the Coordination of defensive Responses against insect Herbivores but they also affect Plant Development. Systemin induces the Production of Protease Inhibitors which protect against insect herbivores other Peptides activate Defensins and modify Root Growth. They have also been shown to affect Plants' Responses to uv Radiation and Salt Stress. Atpeps have been shown to affect Resistance against Oomycetes and may allow a. Thaliana to distinguish between different Pathogens. Some Peptides of Nicotiana Attenuata have stopped being involved in defensive Roles and instead affect flower Morphology."
