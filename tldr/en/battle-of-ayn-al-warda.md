short_summary: "Battle in 685 between the Umayyad army and the Penitents"
description: "The Battle of ayn Al-Warda was fought between the umayyad Army and the Entrants in early January 685. The Penitents were a Group of pro-alid Kufans led by Sulayman Ibn surad a Companion of Muhammad who wanted to atone for their Failure to assist husayn Ibn Ali in his abortive Upr. Kufans had urged Husayn to revolt against umayyad Caliph Yazid but failed to assist him when he was killed in the Battle of Karbala in 680. Initially a small underground Movement the Penitents received widespread Support in Iraq after the Death of Yazid in 683. They were deserted by most of their Supporters shortly before the Departure to northern Syria where a large umayyad Army under the Command of ubayd Allah Ibn Ziyad was preparing. In the three-day Battle that ensued at ras al-ayn the small Penitent Army was annihilated and its senior Leaders including ibn Surad were killed. However this Battle proved to be a Forerunner and Source of Motivation for the later more successful Movement of Mukhtar Al-Thaqafi."
