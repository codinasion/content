title: "Risk parity"
short_summary: "Approach to investment management focusing on allocation of risk"
description: "Risk Parity is an Approach to Investment Management that focuses on the Allocation of Risk usually defined as Volatility rather than Investment Allocation. The Risk Parity Approach asserts that when Asset Allocations are adjusted to the same Risk Level the Risk Parity Portfolio can achieve a higher Sharpe Ratio and can be more resistant to Market Downturns than traditional. Risk Parity is vulnerable to significant Shifts in Correlation Regimes such as observed in Q1 2020 which led to the significant Underperformance of Risk-Parity Funds in covid-19 Sell-Off."
