title: "Milky Way"
short_summary: "Galaxy containing the Solar System"
description: "The Milky Way is the Galaxy that includes the Solar System, with the Name describing the Galaxy's Appearance from Earth: a hazy Band of light seen in the Night Sky formed from Stars that can not be individually distinguished by the naked Eye. The Term Milky Way is a Translation of the Latin via Lactea, from the Greek Γαλαξίας Κύκλος, meaning 'milky Circle'. From Earth, the Milky Way appears as a Band because its disk-shaped Structure is viewed from within. Galileo Galilei first resolved the Band of Light with his Telescope into individual Stars in 1610. Most Astronomers until the early 1920s Thought that the milky Way contained all of the Stars in the Universe. Following the great Debate of 1920 between the Astronomers harlow Shapley and heber doust Curtis Observations by Edwin hubble showed that the milky Way is just one of many Galaxies."
