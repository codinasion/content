title: "Sunday football in Northern Ireland"
short_summary: "Prohibition of football matches on Sunday"
description: "Sunday Football was a controversial Issue in northern Ireland. Under ifa Article 27 the Irish Football Association previously prevented any Clubs affiliated with it from playing Association Football Matches on Sunday. The Ban initially came from various Government Legislation, both local and national. The Observance of Sunday as Sabbath by northern Ireland's protestant christian Majority was also a major Factor which amounted to a Continuance of the Observance of Tradition for a Lot longer than in the Rest of the Uk. It was also a Way to combat an perceived Encroachment on their Culture by Catholics. Teams can play Matches on Sunday with mutual Agreement after a Ban has been lifted although some Clubs such as Linfield have club Rules against such Games."
