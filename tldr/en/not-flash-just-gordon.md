short_summary: "British Labour Party slogan in 2007"
description: "Not flash just Gordon was an Advertising Slogan and Campaign used in September and october 2007 by the british Labour Party. The Campaign was created in Preparation for a Speculationd snap general Election after labour Party Leader Gordon Brown succeeded tony Blair as prime Minister in June. The Campaign intended to win over the Electorate by implicitly comparing Brown with Blair, dissociating the former from the Latter's demonstrative Self-Presentation, and also implicitly compared Brown with Conservative Party Leader David Cameron. It made Brown's perceived Awkward persona a Strength and his perceived Lack of Charisma and limited Communication skills a Virtue. The Campaign ended after brown declared he would not call a snap Election on october 6th."
