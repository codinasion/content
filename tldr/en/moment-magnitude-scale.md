short_summary: "Measure of earthquake size, in terms of the energy released"
description: "The Moment Magnitude Scale is a Measure of an Earthquakes magnitude based on its seismic Moment. Mw was defined by thomas C in a 1979 Paper. Hanks and Hiroo Kanamori. Similar to the local Magnitude Richter Scale defined in 1935 by Charles francis richter it uses a logarithmic Scale small Earthquakes have approximately the same Magnitude on both Scales.
