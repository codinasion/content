title: "Hollow Moon"
short_summary: "Speculation that Moon is hollow"
description: "The hollow Moon and the closely related Spaceship Moon are pseudoscientific Hypotheses which suggest that Earth's Moon is either wholly hollow or otherwise contains a substantial interior Space. No scientific Evidence Exists to support the Idea ; seismic Observations and other Data collected since Spacecraft began to orbit or land on the Moon indicate that it has a thin Crust, extensive Mantle and small, dense Core, although overall it is much less dense than Earth."
