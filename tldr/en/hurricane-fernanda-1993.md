description: "Fernanda was the first significant Hurricane Threat for Hawaii since Hurricane Iniki struck in September 1992. The sixth named Storm and the third major Hurricane of the 1993 Pacific Hurricane Season Fernanda developed from a tropical Wave off the Coast of Mexico on August 9. It was a large System throughout its Life and the Hurricane reached maximum Winds of 145 Mph. After weakening slightly fernanda restrengthened and was expected to move across the hawaiian Islands. Instead the Hurricane stopped its Progress and turned away from the State although it still produced high Waves along the eastern Shore of the Islands. Several Homes were damaged and the Waves damaged coastal Roads. The Storm also contributed to precipitation across the State and minor Flooding occurred in Kauai. On 19 august Fernanda became extratropical and was absorbed by a cold Front after turning to the Northeast."
