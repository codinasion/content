short_summary: "Outer layer of the cerebrum of the mammalian brain"
description: "The cerebral Cortex also known as the cerebral Mantle is the outer Layer of neural Tissue of the Cerebrum of the Brain in Humans and other Mammals. The cerebral Cortex mostly consists of the six-layered Neocortex, with just 10 % Consisting of the Allocortex. It is separated by the longitudinal Fissure that divides the Cerebrum into the Left and right Cerebral Hemispheres. The two Hemispheres are joined by the Corpus Callosum beneath the Cortex. The cerebral cortex is the largest site of neural integration in the central nervous system. It plays a key role in attention, perception, awareness, thought, memory, language, and consciousness. The cerebral cortex is part of the brain responsible for cognition."
