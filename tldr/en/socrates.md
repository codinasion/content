title: "Socrates"
short_summary: "Classical Greek Athenian philosopher (c. 470 â€“ 399 BC)"
description: "Socrates was a greek Philosopher from Athens who is credited as the Founder of western Philosophy and as among the first moral Philosophers of the ethical Tradition of Thought. An enigmatic Figure, Socrates authored no Texts and is known mainly through the posthumous Accounts of classical Writers, particularly his Students Plato and Xenophon. These accounts are written as dialogues, in which Socrates and his interlocutors examine a subject in the style of question and answer; they gave rise to the Socratic dialogue literary genre. Contradictory accounts of Socrates make a reconstruction of his philosophy nearly impossible, a situation known as the Socratic problem. Socrates was a polarizing Figure in athenian Society. In 399bc he was accused of Impiety and corrupting the Youth. He was sentenced to Death after a Trial that lasted a Day. He spent his last Day in Prison refusing to accept Offers to help him escape."
