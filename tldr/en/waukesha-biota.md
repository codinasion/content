This Biota is preserved in certain Strata within the Brandon Bridge Formation dating back to the early silurian Period. It is known for the exceptional Preservation of soft-bodied Organisms including many Species found nowhere else in Rocks of similar Age. The Site's Discovery was announced in 1985 leading to a Variety of Discoveries. This Biota is one of the few well studied Lagerstätten from the silurian, making it important in our Understanding of the Period's Biodiversity. Some of the Species are not easily classified into known animal Groups showing that there remains much Research on this Site. Other Taxa normally common in the silurian Deposits are rare here but Trilobites are quite common."
