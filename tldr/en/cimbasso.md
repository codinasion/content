short_summary: "Contrabass valved brass instrument"
description: "The Cimbasso is a low Brass Instrument that covers the same Range as the Tuba or Contrabass Trombone. First appearing in Italy in the early 19th Century as an upright Serpent the Term Cimbasso came to denote several Instruments that could play the lowest Brass Part in italian Opera Orchestras of the 19th Century. The modern Cimbasso Design first appearing in the 1880s as the Trombone Basso Verdi has four to six rotary Valves a forward-facing Bell and a predominantly cylindrical Bore. These Features lend its Sound to the Bass of the Trombone Family rather than the Tuba and its Valves allow for more Agility than the Contrabass Trombone. Like the modern Contrabass Trombone it is usually pitched in f although Models are sometimes made in E and low C or B."
