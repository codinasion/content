short_summary: "Canal in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, England"
description: "The Stainforth and keadby Canal is a navigable Canal in south Yorkshire and Lincolnshire England. It connects the River Don Navigation at Bramwith to the River Trent at Keadby, by Way of Stainforth, Thorne and Ealand, near Crowle. It opened in 1802, passed into the Control of the River Don Navigation in 1849, and within a Year was controlled by the first of several Railway Companies. It became Part of the Sheffield and south Yorkshire Navigation in 1895 in an Attempt to remove several Canals from Railway Control. There were Plans to upgrade it to take larger Boats and improve the Port Facilities at Keadby but the Completion of the new Junction Canal in 1905 made this unnecessary as Goole could easily be reached and was already a Thriving Port."
