title: "Item number"
short_summary: "Musical performance in Indian cinema"
description: "In indian Cinema a Number of Item or special Songs is a musical Number inserted in a Film that may or may not have any Relevance to the Plot. The Term is commonly used within indian Films and to a lesser Extent within Pakistani Films to describe a Catchy Upbeat often provocative Dance Sequence for a Song performed in a Film. The main Purpose of an Item Number is to entertain Film-Goers and to lend Support to the Marketability of the Film by being featured in Trailers. They are favoured by Filmmakers as they afford the Opportunity to pick potential Hit Songs from Stocks since they do not add to the Continuity of the Plot. It is therefore a Vehicle for commercial Success that ensures repeated viewing."
