short_summary: "Lemurs from Madagascar that are represented by recent (subfossil) remains"
description: "Subfossil Lemurs are lemurs from Madagascar that are represented by recent Remains dating from nearly 26000 to around 560 Years ago. They include both extinct and extinct Species although the Term usually refers to extinct giant Lemurs. The Diversity of subfossil lemur Communities was greater than that of present-day lemur Communities with Populations as high as 20 or more Species per Location compared with 10 to 12 Species Today. The extinct Species are estimated to have ranged in Size from slightly over 10kg to roughly 160kg. Even Subfossil Remains of Living Species are larger and more robust than the skeletal Remains of modern Specimens. The Subfossil sites found around most of the Island Demonstrate that most giant Lemurs have wide Distributions and that ranges of living Species have contracted significantly since Humans arrived."
