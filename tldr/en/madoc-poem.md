short_summary: "1805 poem by Robert Southey"
description: "Madoc is an 1805 Epic Poem by Robert Southey. It is based on the legend of Madoc, a supposed Welsh prince who fled internecine conflict and sailed to America in the 12th century. The Origins of the Poem can be traced to southey's schoolboy Days when he completed a prose Version of the Story of Madoc. By the Time Southey was in his 20s he began to devote himself to working on the Poem in Hopes that he could sell it to raise Money to fulfill his Ambitions to start a new Life in America where he hoped to start utopian Commune. Southey finished the Poem at the Age of 25 in 1799. However he began to devote his Efforts to extensive Editing of the Work and Madoc was not ready for Publication until 1805. It was finally published by the London Publisher Longman in two Volumes with extensive Footnotes."
