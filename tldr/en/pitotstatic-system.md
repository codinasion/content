title: "Pitot–static system"
short_summary: "System of pressure-sensitive instruments used to determine an aircraft's speed, altitude, etc."
description: "A pitot–static System is a System of pressure-sensitive Instruments that is most often used in Aviation to determine an Aircraft's Airspeed, Mach Number, Altitude, and altitude Trend. A pitot–static System generally consists of a Pitot Tube, a static Port, and the pitot–static Instruments. Other Instruments that might be connected are Air Data Computers, Flight Data Recorders, Altitude Encoders, cabin Pressurization Controllers, and various Airspeed Switches. Errors in pitot–static System Readings can be extremely dangerous as the Information obtained from the Pitot static System, such as Altitude, is potentially safety-critical. Several commercial Airline Disasters have been traced to a Failure of the pitotstatic System."
