short_summary: "Extinct genus of lemurs"
description: "Pachylemur is an extinct Giant lemur closely related to the Ruffed Lemurs of the Genus Varecia. Two Species are known, Pachylemur Insignis and Pachylemur Jullyi, although there is some Doubt as to whether or not they may actually be the same Species. The Pachylemur is sometimes referred to as the giant Ruffed Lemur because although it and the Living Ruffed Lemurs had similar Teeth and Skeletons Pachylemur was more robust and as much as three to four Times larger. Dna Studies have confirmed a Sister-Group Relationship between these two Types of Lemur. Like living Ruffed Lemurs, Pachylemur specialized in eating Fruit, and was therefore an important Seed Disperser, possibly for tree Species with Seeds too large for even ruffed lemurs to swallow. The spiny Thickets of southwestern Madagascar were also likely to have dispersed Seeds which evolved to attach to fur and be carried away. Unlike Ruffed lemurs the Fore and Hind Legs of the Pachylemur were approximately the same Length and therefore it was likely to be a slow Deliberate Climber. However, both used Hindlimb Suspension to reach Fruit on small Branches below them."
