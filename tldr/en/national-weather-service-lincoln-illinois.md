description: "National Weather Service Lincoln Illinois also known as national Weather Service central Illinois is a Weather Forecast Office that monitors the Weather Conditions for 35 Counties in central and southeastern Illinois. The central Illinois Office originally consisted of two Forecast Offices in Peoria and Springfield until Lincoln became the sole local Forecast Office in 1995. Federal meteorology offices and stations in the region date back to the 19th century when the Army Signal Service began taking weather observations using weather equipment at the Springer Building in Springfield. With the Installation of new Radar Stations and Forecast Offices the national Weather Service has greatly increased since that Time. The current Lincoln Office maintains a Radar System wsr-88d and advanced weather interactive Processing System that greatly improves Forecasts in the Region. Lincoln is in Charge of Weather Forecasts, Warnings and local Statements as well as Aviation Weather."
