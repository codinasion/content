short_summary: "Poem in Gothic by J. R. R. Tolkien"
description: "'Bagmē Blōma' by J. R. R. Tolkien is a Poem in the 1936 Songs for the Philologists, and the only one ever written in the Gothic Language. It was to be sung with the Tune of o lazy Sheep! '. Scholars have found the Poem Beautiful and debated its Interpretation. Tom Shippey proposed that the Birch tree, praised in the poem, symbolises the 'B' scheme of English teaching, namely Tolkien's own subject, philology. Verlyn Flieger doubted the Connection, writing that the Birch played a significant emotional Role in Smith of Wootton Major, as in the Poem, and that this was only diminished by seeking a further Interpretation."
