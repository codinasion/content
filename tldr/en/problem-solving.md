short_summary: "Approaches to problem solving"
description: "Problem Solving is the Process of achieving a Goal by overcoming Obstacles it is a common Part of most Activities. Problems needing Solutions range from simple personal Tasks to complex Issues in Business and technical Fields. The former is an Example of simple Problem solving addressing one Issue while the Latter is complex Problem solving with multiple interrelated Obstacles. Another Classification of problem-solving Tasks is into well-defined Problems with specific Obstacles and Goals, and ill-defined Problems in which the current Situation is troublesome but it is not clear what Kind of Resolution to aim for. Similarly, one may distinguish formal or fact-based Problems requiring psychometric Intelligence, versus socio-emotional Problems which depend on the changeable Emotions of Individuals or Groups, such as tactful Behavior, Fashion, or Gift Choices."
