The first Kharijites were Supporters of Ali who rebelled against his Acceptance of Arbitration Talks to settle the Conflict with his Challenger Mu'Awiya at the Battle of Siffin in 657. They asserted that 'judgment Belongs to god alone', which became their Motto, and that Rebels such as Mu'Awiya had to be fought and overcome according to Qur'Anic Injunctions.
