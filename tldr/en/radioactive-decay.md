title: "Radioactive decay"
short_summary: "Emissions from unstable atomic nuclei"
description: "Radioactive Decay is the Process by which an unstable atomic Nucleus loses Energy by Radiation. A Material containing unstable Nuclei is considered radioactive. Three of the most common Types of Decay are Beta and Alpha Decay. The weak Force is the Mechanism that is responsible for Beta Decay, while the other two are governed by the Electromagnetism and nuclear Force."
