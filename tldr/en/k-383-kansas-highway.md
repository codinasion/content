description: "K-383 is a State Highway in Kansas, United States. The Highway runs 74. 042 miles from U. S. Route 83 and K-23 near Selden North and East to Us-183 near Woodruff, just South of the Nebraska State Line. K-383 runs Southwestâ€“Northeast and Connects Norton with Colby to the Southwest and Alma, Nebraska, to the Northeast via the Valley of Prairie Dog Creek, a Tributary of the Republican River. The Highway also serves the Cities of Selden in northern Sheridan County ; Dresden, Jennings, and Clayton in southeastern Decatur County ; Almena in eastern Norton County ; and Long Island in northern Phillips County. K-383 was assigned in 1981 over Portions of the former Us-383 that had not run concurrently with us-83 or us-183. The Highway was originally designated as Parts of us-36 and K-22 in the Mid-1920S. The entire Route became us-83 and was placed in the early 1930s on much of its modern Alignment replacing the original Path that followed Section Lines. The Route was designated us-383 in the Mid-1940S and paved from the late 1930s until the late 1940S. The Highway was moved to norton in the late 1930S and early 1940S. Other relocations of K-383 have included the segment near Clayton in the mid-1950s, southwest of Norton in the late 1930s and again in the early 1960s, and at both ends of the highway in the early 1990s."
