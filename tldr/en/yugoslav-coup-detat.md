title: "Yugoslav coup d'Ã©tat"
short_summary: "1941 deposition of Regent Prince Paul; installation of King Peter II"
description: "The Yugoslav Coup D'At took Place in Belgrade Kingdom of Yugoslavia on March 27 1941 when the Regency led by Prince Paul of Yugoslavia was overthrown and king Peter Ii fully assumed monarchical Powers. The Coup was planned and led by a Group of pro-western serb Nationalist Royal Yugoslav Air Force Officers led formally by Air Force Commander general Duan Simovi who had been associated with several Putsch Plots from 1938 Onwards. The major Ivan Kneevi of the Yugoslav Royal Guards and his Brother Radoje Kneevi were the main Organisers in the Overthrow of the Government. Several other civilian Leaders were probably aware of the Takeover before it was launched and moved to support it once it happened but they were not among the Organisers. Peter Ii himself was surprised by the Coup, and Heard of the Declaration of his Coming-Of-Age for the first Time on the Radio."
