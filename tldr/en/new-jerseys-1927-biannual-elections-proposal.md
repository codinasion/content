title: "New Jersey's 1927 biannual elections proposal"
short_summary: "Attempt to extend terms of offices"
description: "An unsuccessful Attempt was made in 1926 and 1927 to pass an Amendment to the Constitution of new Jersey. The Intent of the Amendment was to serve as two-year Members of the new Jersey general Assembly rather than one and to extend the Terms of State Senators and Governor from three Years to four Years. The proposed Amendment was passed by the Legislature twice and the Text was approved by the Attorney General. Before the Proposal could be submitted for final Approval it was noticed that although the Legislature intended that Assembly Members be elected biennially the proposed Amendment provided that they were elected twice a Year. After this discovery, the legislature passed a resolution defining 'biannually' to mean 'biennially', and proceeded with the referendum. The new Jersey People voted down the Proposal on 20 September 1927 and assembly Members were elected annually until new Jersey instituted a new Constitution in 1947."
