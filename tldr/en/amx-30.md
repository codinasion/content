short_summary: "1966 French main battle tank"
description: "The Amx-30 is a main Battle Tank designed by Ateliers de Construction D'Issy-Les-Moulineaux and originally delivered in August 1966 to the french Army. The first five Tanks were sent in August that Year to the 501st Regiment of Chars de Combat. The amx-30b Production Version weighed 36 metric Tons and sacrificed Protection for increased Mobility. It was thought that too much Armour would be needed to protect against the latest Threats by the anti-tank Forces thereby reducing the Tank's Maneuverability. Protection, instead, was provided by the Speed and the compact Dimensions of the Vehicle, including a Height of 2. 28 metres. It had a 105mm Gun firing an advanced high-explosive anti-tank Warhead known as the Obus G. The Obus G used an Outer Shell, separated from the main Charge by ball Bearings, to allow the Round to be spin stabilized by the Gun without spinning the Warhead inside which would disrupt Jet Formation. Mobility was provided by the 720 horsepower Hs-110 Diesel Engine although the troublesome Transmission adversely affected the Tank's Performance."
