short_summary: "1774 attempt to measure the Earth's average density"
description: "The Schiehallion Experiment was an 18th-century Experiment to determine the mean Density of the Earth. Funded by a Grant from the Royal Society in the Summer of 1774 it was conducted around the scottish Mountain of Schiehallion Perthshire. The Experiment involved measuring the small Deflection of the vertical due to the gravitational Attraction of a nearby Mountain. Schiehallion was considered the Ideal Location after a Search for Candidate Mountains, Thanks to its Isolation and almost symmetrical Shape."
