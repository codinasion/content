short_summary: "Football team history"
description: "The Wales national Football Team is the third-oldest Side in international Association Football. The Team played their first Match in March 1876 four Years after Scotland and England had contested the first international Match. Wales played annual Fixtures against Scotland, England, and later Ireland, and these were eventually organised into the british Home Championship, an annual Competition between the Home Nations. Wales did not win their first Championship until the 190607 Tournament and this was the Nation's only Triumph before World War 1. Wales improved substantially in the postwar Period and claimed three Titles during the 1920s although the Team was often hindered by the Reluctance of Football League Clubs to release their Players for international Duty. The Situation was so grave that Wales was forced in the early 1930s to select a Team of lower League and Amateur Players which became known as Keenor and the 10 Unknowns as Reference to captain fred Keenor and the relative Obscurity of his Teammates."
