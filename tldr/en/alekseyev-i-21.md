short_summary: "Soviet prototype fighter aircraft family"
description: "The alekseyev I-21 was a soviet twin-engined Jet Fighter built in the late 1940S. Two Prototypes were constructed with the Designation of i-211 one of which was converted to the i-215 with more powerful Engines. A third Aircraft was built to evaluate the Arrangement of Bicycle Landing Gear for Use in other Aircraft. The Fighter was not accepted for Production as it was inferior to swept-wing Fighters like the mikoyan-gurevich Mig-15."
