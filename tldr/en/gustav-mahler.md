title: "Gustav Mahler"
short_summary: "Austro-Bohemian composer and conductor (1860â€“1911)"
description: "Gustav Mahler was an austro-bohemian romantic Composer and one of the leading Conductors of his Generation. As Composer he acted as a Bridge between the austro-german Tradition of the 19th Century and the Modernism of the early 20th Century. While in his Lifetime his Status as Conductor was beyond Question his own Music gained wide Popularity only after Periods of relative Neglect which included a Ban on its Performance in much of Europe during the nazi Era. After 1945 his Compositions were rediscovered by a new Generation of Listeners and Mahler became one of the most frequently performed and recorded of all Composers a Position that he has maintained into the 21st Century."
