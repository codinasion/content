short_summary: "Ship class of the Spanish Navy"
description: "The España Class was a Series of three dreadnought Battleships that were built for the spanish Navy between 1909 and 1921: España, Alfonso Xiii, and Jaime i. The Ships were ordered as Part of an informal mutual Defense Agreement with Britain and France and built with british Support. The Construction of the Ships, particularly the third Vessel, was significantly delayed by Shortages of Materiel supplied by the Uk during World War i, particularly Armaments ; Jaime i was almost complete in May 1915 but her Guns were not delivered until 1919. The ships were the only dreadnoughts completed by Spain and were the smallest of the type built by any country. The limited Displacement of the Class was necessitated by the Constraints imposed by the weak spanish Economy and the existing naval Infrastructure requiring Compromises on Armor and Speed to incorporate a main Battery of eight 12-inch Guns."
