title: "Fess"
short_summary: "Ordinary in heraldic blazon in the form of a single, isolated horizontal band"
description: "In heraldry a Fesse or Fesse is a Charge on a Coat of Arms that takes the Form of a Band running horizontally across the Centre of the Shield. Writers disagree in how much of the Shield's Surface should be covered by Fess or other ordinary. The Oxford Guide to heraldry States that earlier Writers including leigh Holme and guillim favour One-Third while later Writers such as edmondson favour One-Fifth on the Grounds that a bend Pale or Chevron occupying One-Third of the Field makes the Coat Look. 'a Fess is likely to be shown narrower if it is uncharged, that is, if it does not have other Charges placed on it, and/or if it is to be shown with Charges above and below it ; and shown Wider if charged. The Fess or Bar termed Fasce in french Heraldry should not be confused with Fasces."
