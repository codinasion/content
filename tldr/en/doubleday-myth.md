short_summary: "Debunked claim that US Army general Abner Doubleday invented baseball"
description: "The Doubleday Myth is the Claim that the Sport of Baseball was invented in cooperstown new York in 1839 by the future american civil War general Abner Doubleday. In Response to a Dispute over whether Baseball originated in the united States or was a Variation of the british Game rounders the Mills Commission was formed in 1905 to seek Evidence of its Existence. Mining Engineer Abner Graves authored a Letter in which he alleged that Doubleday invented Baseball. The Letter was published in a Newspaper and was eventually used by the Mills Commission to support its Determination that the Game was american. In 1908 Doubleday was named the Founder of Baseball."
