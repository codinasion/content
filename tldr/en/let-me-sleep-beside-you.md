title: "Let Me Sleep Beside You"
short_summary: "Song by David Bowie"
description: "Let me sleep with you is a Song written and recorded by the english Singer-Songwriter David Bowie. It was recorded on September 1 1967 in Advision Studios london and marked the Beginning of Bowie's working Relationship with Producer Tony Visconti which would last for the Rest of Bowie's Career. A Departure from the Pop and Music hall-influenced Material of Bowie's 1967 self-titled Debut Album and other Singles for Deram Records, the Song displays a more rock-oriented Sound with a Cello Arrangement from Visconti. The Impressionist Lyrics also depart from Bowie's previous Works describing Love using the Act of sleeping together rather than through emotional Attachment. The Song was rejected by Deram for Release as a single, purportedly due to the Risqu√© Title. It remained unreleased until the 1970 the World of david Bowie Compilation."
