description: "Science Fantasy, which also appeared under the Titles Impulse and Sf Impulse, was a british Fantasy and Science Fiction Magazine, launched in 1950 by Nova Publications as a Companion to Nova's New Worlds. Walter Gillings was Editor for the first two Issues and was then replaced as a cost-saving Measure by John carnell the Editor of new Worlds. Carnell edited both Magazines until nova went out of Business in early 1964. The Titles were acquired by Roberts Vinter who hired Kyril Bonfiglioli to edit Science Fantasy Bonfiglioli changed the Title to impulse in early 1966 but the new Title led to Confusion with the Distributors and Sales fell though the Magazine remained profitable.
