description: "Peace on Earth is the first Christmas album by American Christian rock band Casting Crowns. Produced by Mark Hall and Mark A. Miller it was published on October 7 2008. Intended by Hall to highlight the worshipful Aspect of Christmas the Album does not have Songs relating to secular christmas Traditions instead it features a Mix of traditional Christmas Carols and original Songs. As Co-Producer, Hall attempted to differentiate the Album from their previous Ones by attempting to use creative Ideas they had not tried before, and he also wanted to utilize the Band's female Members in a broader and more visible Role on the Album."
