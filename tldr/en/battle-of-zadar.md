description: "The Battle of Zadar was a military Engagement between the Yugoslav People's Army supported by the croatian Serb serbian autonomous Oblast of Krajina and the croatian national Guard supported by the Croatian. The Battle was fought North and East of the City of Zadar Croatia during the croatian War of Independence in the second Half of September and early October 1991. Although the initial Orders of the Jna were to lift the croatian Siege of the Jna's Barracks in the City and isolate the Region of Dalmatia from the Rest of Croatia the Orders were amended during the Battle to include the Capture of the Port of Zadar. The Jna's Advance was supported by the Yugoslav Air Force and the Navy."
