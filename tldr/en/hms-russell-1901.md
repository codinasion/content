short_summary: "Pre-dreadnought battleship of the British Royal Navy"
description: "Hms Russell was a royal navy naval Battleship of the duncan Class in 1903. Russell and her sister Ships were built to counter a Group of fast russian Battleships capable of steaming at 19 Knots making them the fastest Battleships in the World. The duncan-class Battleships were armed with a main Battery of four 12-inch Guns and they were broadly similar to the london-class Battleships but with a slightly reduced Displacement and a Thinner Armor Layout. As such they reflected the Development of lighter Second-Class Ships of the Canopus-Class Battleships. Russell was constructed between her Keel Laying in March 1899 and her Completion in february 1903."
