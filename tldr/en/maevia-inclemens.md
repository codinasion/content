description: "Maevia Inclemens or the dimorphic Jumping Spider is a relatively common and colorful jumping Spider of north America. In the Males there are two Forms, a very rare Phenomenon in Zoology. These use different Courting Displays, and Differ in Appearance: the 'tufted' Morph has a black Body and Pedipalps, three black Tufts across its 'Head', and pale Legs ; and the 'gray' Morph has black and white Stripes all over its Body and Legs, Orange Palps, and no Tufts. However, each Form accounts for 50 % of the Adult Males, and they are equally successful in Mating. A female of Maevia inclemens is 6. 5 to 8. 0 Millimetres long, while Males are 4. 75 to 6. 50 millimetres long."
