short_summary: "Type of plane curve"
description: "In Geometry a Convex Curve is a Plane Curve that has a Supporting Line through each of its Points. There are many other equivalent Definitions of these Curves dating back to Archimedes. Examples of Convex Curves include the convex Polygons the Boundaries of convex Sets and the Graphs of Convex Functions. Important Subclasses of Convex Curves include closed Convex curves the smooth Curves that are convex and the strictly convex Curves which have the additional Property of each supporting Line passing through a unique Point of the."
