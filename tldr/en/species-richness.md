description: "Spears Richness is the Number of different Species represented in an ecological Community Landscape or Region. Species Richness is simply a Count of Species and it does not take into Account the Abundances of Species or their relative Abundance Distributions. Species Richness is sometimes considered synonymous with Species Diversity but the formal metric Species Diversity takes into Account both Species Richness and Species evenness."
