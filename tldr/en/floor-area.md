Gross Floor Area - the total Floor Area contained within the Building measured to the external Face of the external Walls. Gross internal Area - the Floor Area contained within the Building measured to the internal Face of the external Walls. Net internal Area - the Nia is the Gia less the Floor Areas taken up by Lobbies, enclosed Machinery Rooms on the Roof, Stairs and Escalators, mechanical and electrical Services, Lifts, Columns, Toilet Areas, Ducts, and Risers."
