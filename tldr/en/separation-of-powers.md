short_summary: "Division of a state's government into branches"
description: "Separation of Power is the Division of the State Government into Branches each with independent independent Powers and Responsibilities so that the Powers of one Branch are not in Conflict with Others. The typical Division into three Branches of Government sometimes called the Trias Politica Model includes a Legislature an Executive and a Judiciary. It can be contrasted with the Fusion of Powers in Monarchies, but also parliamentary and semi-presidential Systems where there can be overlap in Membership and Functions between different Branches, especially the Executive and legislative."
