title: "Sino-Roman relations"
short_summary: "Bilateral international relationship"
description: "Sino-roman Relations comprised the Contacts and Flows of Trade Goods, Information, and occasional Travelers between the Roman Empire and the Han Dynasty, as well as between the later Eastern Roman Empire and various successive chinese Dynasties that followed. In the Course of the roman Expansion into ancient western Asia and of the simultaneous Han military Incursions into central asia these Empires began to converge closer together. Mutual Awareness remained low and Firm Knowledge about each other was limited. Surviving Records Document only a few Attempts at direct Contact. Intermediate Empires such as the Parthians and Kushans seeking Control over the lucrative Silk Trade inhibited direct Contact between these two eurasian Powers. In 97 Ad the chinese general Ban Chao tried to send his Envoy Gan ying to rome but Parthians dissuaded Gan from venturing beyond the persian Gulf. Ancient chinese Historians recorded several alleged Roman Emissaries to china. The first One on Record, supposedly either from the Roman Emperor Antoninus Pius or from his adopted Son Marcus Aurelius, arrived in 166 Ad. Others are recorded as arriving in 226 and 284 Ad followed by a long Hiatus until the first recorded Byzantine Embassy was established in 643 Ad."
