description: "Castaing Machine is a Machine used to add Lettering and Decoration to the Edge of a Coin. Such Lettering was necessitated by counterfeiting and Edge Clipping which was a common Problem resulting from uneven and irregular hammered Coinage. When Aubin olivier introduced milled Coins to france he also developed a Method of marking the Edges with lettering making it possible to identify if Metal had been shaved from the Edge. This Method involved using a Collar into which the Metal was released from the Pressure of the Press. This Method was slower and more costly than earlier Methods. In 1585 France opted to stop milling the Coinage in Favor of hammering."
