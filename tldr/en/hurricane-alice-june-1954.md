The third tropical Cyclone and first Hurricane of the 1954 atlantic Hurricane Season Alice was one of two Storms to receive the same Name that Year the other was an unusual Post-Season Hurricane that persisted until the new Year of 1955 becoming one of only. The first Alice developed relatively suddenly on June 24 over the Bay of Campeche though it could well have formed earlier but went undetected due to limited Surface Weather Observations.
