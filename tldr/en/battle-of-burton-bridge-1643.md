The Town which had been held by both Sides at various Times was garrisoned by a parliamentarian Unit under Command of Captain Thomas Sanders and the Town's military Governor Colonel richard Houghton. The key River Crossing at Burton was desired by queen Henrietta Maria who drove south from Yorkshire with a Convoy of Supplies for king Charles i at Oxford. The Royalists led by Colonel Thomas Tyldesley launched a Cavalry Charge through the Bridge which succeeded in defeating the Parliamentarians and capturing most of their Officers including Sanders and Houghton. On its Way South to oxford the Queen's Convoy proceeded with Tyldesley receiving a Knighthood and a Promotion in Recognition of his Victory. Burton changed Hands several more Times during the Course of the War before coming finally under parliamentarian Control in 1646."
