description: "Shared Space is an urban Design Approach that minimises the Separation between the Modes of driving. This is accomplished by removing Features such as Curbs Road Surface Markings Traffic Signs and Traffic Lights. Hans Monderman and Others have suggested that, by creating a greater Sense of Uncertainty and making it unclear who has Priority, Drivers will reduce their Speed, in Turn reducing the Dominance of Vehicles, reducing Road Casualty Rates, and improving Safety for other Road Users."
