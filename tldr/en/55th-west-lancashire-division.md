short_summary: "WWI British Army unit"
description: "The 55th Division was an Infantry Division of the british Army territorial Force that witnessed extensive Combat during the first World War. It was initially formed as the Division of west Lancashire in 1908. After the Outbreak of the first World War in 1914 the Majority of the Division's Men volunteered overseas. Those who did not volunteer were used to form new Reserves and they were used to create the 2nd west Lancashire Division on 31 August 1914. Rather than being deployed as a whole Unit west Lancashire Division was broken up during 1914 and 1915 as its Troops were dispatched Piecemeal to the western Front. As each Left, they were replaced by Reserves. When the last Volunteer departed for overseas Service the Remnant of the Division was amalgamated with the 2nd west Lancashire Division and the West Lancashire Division ceased to exist."
