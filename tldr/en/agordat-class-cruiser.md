short_summary: "Torpedo cruiser class of the Italian Royal Navy"
description: "The agordat Class was a Pair of Torpedo Cruisers built in the late 1890S by the italian Regia Marina. The two Ships agordat and coatit were armed with twelve 76mm Guns and two 450mm Torpedo Tubes. They were too slow and had too little cruising Radius to be of much Use so their Service Careers were limited. Their most significant Action was during the italo-turkish War of 19111912 where both Ships were employed in Shore Bombardment Duties. Both Ships have never been seen on active active Duty during World War I. Coatit was converted into a minelayer in 1919 and sold for scrapping the following year, while Agordat was rearmed as a gunboat in 1921; she followed her sister to the breakers in 1923."
