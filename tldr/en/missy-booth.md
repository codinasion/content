description: "Missy Booth is a fictional Character from the Channel 4 School Drama Ackley Bridge, portrayed by Poppy Lee Friar. Missy appeared first in the Pilot Episode of the Series on June 7 2017. She is introduced as one of the Programme's two Protagonists alongside best Friend Nasreen Paracha. Due to growing up with numerous Responsibilities including being the Carer of her Family, Friar described her Character as a 'Fighter'. Despite this, Missy is also seen to be a rebellious and opinionated Character who is popular at School, especially with the male Students. One of the main Themes explored throughout the Series is her Friendship with Nasreen, which Channel 4 billed as the 'Heart of the Show'. Both Hickman and Friar have connected it with their Real-Life Friendship which they felt mirrored their on-screen Friendship."
