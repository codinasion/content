short_summary: "Fully simplified fraction"
description: "An irreducible Fraction is a Fraction in which the Numerator and Denominator are Integers that have no other common Divisor than 1. In other Words, a Fraction A/B is irreducible if and only if a and B are Coprime, that is, if a and B have a greatest common Divisor of 1. In higher Mathematics irreducible Fraction may also refer to rational Fractions such that the Numerator and Denominator are coprime Polynomials. Every rational Number can be represented in exactly one Way as an irreducible Fraction with positive Denominator."
