description: "Wireless Telegraphy or Radiotelegraphy is the Transmission of text Messages via Radio Waves analogous to electrical Telegraphy using Cables. Before 1910 the Term Wireless Telegraphy was also used for other experimental Technologies for transmitting without Wires telegraph Signals. In Radiotelegraphy Information is transmitted by two different Lengths of pulsed Radio Waves called Dots and Dashes which spell out text Messages usually in Morse Code. In a manual System the Sending Operator Taps on a Switch called a Telegraph Key which turns the Transmitter on and off producing the Pulses of Radio Waves. The Pulses at the Receiver are audible in the Speaker of the Receiver as Beeps which are translated back to Text by an Operator who knows Morse Code."
