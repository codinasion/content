short_summary: "2005 studio album by Garbage"
description: "Bleed like Me is the fourth Studio Album by american Rock Band Garbage. It was released Worldwide on 11 April 2005 through Warner Music Imprint Ae Records with a north american Release on the following Day via Geffen Records. For this album, the band chose a straight rock sound reminiscent of their live performances instead of the electronica that permeated their previous album Beautiful Garbage . The first Recordings took Place in March 2003 but were mostly unproductive due to passive Aggression between Band Members and a general Lack of Direction. As they struggled to record the Album, Garbage quietly split for four Months starting in October 2003. They reunited in los Angeles under Producer John King and found a renewed Focus on Production following a guest Appearance by dave Grohl on bad Boyfriend. For new recording Sessions Garbage recruited drummer Matt Walker and Bassist Justin Meldal-Johnsen and completed the Album by late 2004."
