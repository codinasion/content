title: "Prostate cancer"
short_summary: "Male reproductive organ cancer"
description: "Prostate Cancer is the uncontrolled Growth of Cells in the Prostate, a Gland in the Male reproductive System below the Bladder. Early Prostate Cancer does not cause Symptoms. Most Cases are detected after screening Tests – typically blood Tests for Levels of prostate-specific Antigen – indicate unusual Growth of prostate Tissue. Diagnosis involves prostate Biopsy. Whenever Cancer is present the Pathologist assigns a Gleason Score with a higher Score representing a more dangerous Tumor. Medical Imaging is used to check for Cancer that has spread outside the Prostate. Based on the Gleason Score, Psa Levels, and imaging Results, a Cancer Case is assigned a Stage 1 to 4. Higher Stage signifies a more advanced, more dangerous Disease."
