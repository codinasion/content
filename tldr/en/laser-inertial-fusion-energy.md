title: "Laser Inertial Fusion Energy"
short_summary: "Early 2010s fusion energy effort"
description: "Life short for Laser inertial Fusion Energy was a Fusion Energy Effort run between 2008 and 2013 at Lawrence livermore national Laboratory. Life aimed to develop the Technologies needed to convert the laser-driven inertial Confinement Fusion Concept being developed in the national Ignition Facility into a practical commercial Power Plant a Concept generally known as inertial Fusion Energy. Life used the same basic Concepts as Nif, but aimed to lower Costs using mass-produced Fuel Elements, simplified Maintenance, and Diode Lasers with higher electrical Efficiency."
