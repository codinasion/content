short_summary: "Assyrian princess of the Sargonid dynasty"
description: "ŠērūʾA-Ēṭirat, called Saritrah in later Aramaic Texts, was an ancient assyrian Princess of the Sargonid Dynasty, the eldest Daughter of Esarhaddon and the older Sister of his Son and Successor Ashurbanipal. She is the only Esarhaddon's Daughter known by Name and Inscriptions listing the royal Children suggest that she outranked several of her Brothers such as her younger Brother Aur-Mukin-Palea but ranked below the crown Princes ashurbanipal and Sham. Her Importance could be explained by her possibly being the eldest of all Esarhaddon's Children."
