title: "HMS Swordfish (1916)"
short_summary: "British experimental submarine"
description: "Hms Swordfish was an experimental Submarine built for the royal Navy before the first World War to meet the Navy's Goal of an overseas Sub capable of 20 Knots on the Surface. Diesel Engines of the Period were unreliable and not very powerful so steam Turbines were proposed instead to meet the Requirement of the Rn. Swordfish proved slower than designed and unstable during surfacing and consequently was modified as an anti-submarine Patrol Vessel in 1917. She was paid off before the End of the War and sold in 1922 for scrapping."
