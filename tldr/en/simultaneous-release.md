description: "A simultaneous Release, also known as a day-and-date Release, is the Release of a Film on multiple Platforms—Most commonly theatrical and Home video—on the exact same Day, or in very close Proximity to each other. This contrasts with the Industry Standard of having a Window of Exclusivity between theatrical and Home Video Releases."
