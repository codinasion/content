title: "Red team"
short_summary: "Group that provides security feedback"
description: "A red Team is a Group that pretends to be an Enemy attempts a physical or digital Intrusion at the Direction of an Organization then reports back so that the Organization can improve their Defenses. Red teams work for the organization or are hired by the organization. Their Work is legal but can surprise some Employees who may not know that red Teaming is going on or who may be deceived by the red Team. Some Definitions of red Team are broader and include any Group in an Organization that is directed to think outside the Box and Look at alternative Scenarios that are considered less plausible. This can be an important defense against false assumptions and groupthink. The Term red Teaming originated in the united States in the 1960S."
