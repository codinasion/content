short_summary: "Electric circuit composed of resistors and capacitors"
description: "A Resistor Capacitor Circuit or rc Filter or Rc Network is an electrical Circuit composed of Resistors and Capacitors. It may be driven by a Voltage or current Source and these produce different Responses. A first Order Rc Circuit is composed of one Resistor and one Capacitor and is the simplest Type of Rc Circuit."
