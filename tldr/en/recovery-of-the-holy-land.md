title: "Recovery of the Holy Land"
short_summary: "Genre of literature in mediaeval Europe"
description: "The Theme of Recovery of the holy Land was a Genre in middle-late christian Literature about the Crusades. It consisted of Treatises and Memoranda on how to recover the Holy Land for Christendom appearing first in Preparation for the second Council of Lyon in 1274. They proliferated following the Loss of Acre in 1291 shortly after which the permanent Crusader Presence in the holy Land came to an End but mostly disappeared with the Cancellation of Philip Vi of France's planned Crusade in 1336 and the Start of the hundred Years War between. The Peak of Recovery Proposals was the Pontificate of Clement V."
