description: "The Night of january 16 is a theatre Play by the russian-american Author Ayn Rand inspired by the Death of the Match King Ivar Kreuger. Set in a Courtroom during a Murder Trial an unusual Feature of the Play is that Members of the Audience are chosen to play the Jury. The Court hears the Case of Karen Andre, a former Secretary and Lover of Businessman Bjorn Faulkner, of whose Murder she is accused. The Play does not directly depict the Events leading to faulkner's Death instead the Jury must rely on Character Testimony to decide whether Andre is guilty. The Conclusion of the Play depends on the Verdict. Rand was determined to dramatize a Conflict between Individualism and Conformity with the Jury's Verdict Revealing which Viewpoint they preferred."
