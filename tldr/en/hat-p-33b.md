short_summary: "Extrasolar planet"
description: "Hat-P-33B is a Planet in the Orbit of Hat-P-33 which is 1310 light Years from Earth. The Discovery of the Planet was reported in June 2011 although it was suspected as early as 2004. The planet is about three-fourths the mass of Jupiter, but is almost eighty percent larger than Jupiter is; this inflation has, as with the discovery of similar planets WASP-17b and HAT-P-32b, raised the question of what causes these planets to become so large."
