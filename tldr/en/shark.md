title: "Shark"
short_summary: "Infraclass of predatory cartilaginous fish"
description: "Sharks are a Group of elasmobranch fish characterized by a cartilaginous Skeleton characterized by five to seven Gill slits on the Sides of the Head and pectoral Fins that are not fused to the Head. Modern Sharks are classified within the Clade Selachimorpha and are the sister Group of Batoidea. Some Sources extend the Term Shark as an informal Category including extinct Members of Chondrichthyes with a shark-like Morphology such as Hybodonts. Shark-like Chondrichthyans such as Cladoselache and Doliodus first appeared in the devonian Period though some fossilized chondrichthyan-like Scales are as old as the late Ordovician. The oldest confirmed modern Sharks are known from the early Jurassic about 200 million Years ago though Records of true Sharks can extend as far as the permian Period."
