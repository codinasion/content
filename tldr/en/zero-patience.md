The Film Examines and refutes the urban Legend of the alleged Introduction of Hiv by a single individual Gatan Dugas to north America. Dugas, better known as Patient Zero, was the Target of Blame in the popular Imagination in the 1980's in large Measure because of Randy Shilts's american Television Film Docudrama, and the Band Played on, a History of the early Days of the Aids Epidemic. Zero Patience tells its Story against the Backdrop of a Romance between the time-displaced Sir Richard francis Burton and the Ghost of Zero."
