title: "Insect wing"
short_summary: "Body part used by insects to fly"
description: "Insect Wings are adult Outgrowths of the insect Exoskeleton that allow Insects to fly. They are found on the second and third Thoracic Segments, and the two Pairs are often referred to as the Forewings and Hindwings, respectively, though a few Insects lack Hindwings, even Rudiments. The Wings are reinforced by a Number of longitudinal Veins often with Cross-Connections that form closed Cells in the Membrane. The Patterns resulting from the Fusion and Cross-Connection of the Wing Veins are often diagnostic for different evolutionary Lines and can be used to the Family or even Genus level in many Orders of Insects."
