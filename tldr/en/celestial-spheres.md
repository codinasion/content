title: "Celestial spheres"
short_summary: "Elements of some cosmological models"
description: "The celestial Spheres or celestial Orbs were the fundamental Elements of the cosmological Models developed by Plato Eudoxus aristotle Ptolemy Copernicus and Others. The apparent Motions of the fixed Stars and Planets are accounted for in these celestial Models by treating them as embedded in rotating Spheres made of an aetherial Transparent fifth Element like Gems set in Orbs. Since it was believed that the fixed Stars did not change their Positions relative to each other it was argued that they must be on the Surface of a single Starry sphere."
