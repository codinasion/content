title: "Taxonomy of Narcissus"
short_summary: "Classification of daffodils"
description: "The Narcissus Taxonomy is complex and still not fully resolved. Known to the Ancients, the Genus Name appears in Graeco-Roman Literature, although their Interest was as much Medicinal as botanical. It is unclear which species the Ancients knew. Although frequently mentioned in Medieval and Renaissance Texts it was not officially described until the Work of Linnaeus in 1753. By 1789 it had been grouped into a Family but shortly thereafter this was renamed Amaryllideae, from which comes the modern Placement within Amaryllidaceae, although for a While it was considered Part of Liliaceae."
