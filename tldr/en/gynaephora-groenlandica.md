This species remains in the Larval State for the vast Majority of its Life. Rare among Lepidoptera, it undergoes an annual Period of Diapause that lasts for much of the Calendar Year, as G. Groenlandica goes through some of the most extreme Winters on the Earth. In this dormant State it can withstand Temperatures as low as 70c. The arctic woolly bear Moth also exhibits basking Behavior which assists in Temperature Regulation and Digestion and affects both Metabolism and Oxygen Consumption. Females usually do n't fly while Males do."
