description: "The severe tropical Cyclone Sam was an intense tropical Cyclone that in December 2000 brought flooding Rainfall to a large Swath of northern Australia. The first tropical Cyclone of the regional Season Sam originated from a tropical Low that formed on 28 November in the Arafura Sea. Tracking generally west the initial low Pressure Area remained generally weak until it entered the Timor Sea at which Point it had strengthened into a tropical Storm on 5 December. Though a subtropical Ridge at the Time forced the Cyclone west an approaching Shortwave Trough caused Sam to follow southward the following Day towards the australian Coast. During its southward directional Progression Sam rapidly intensified and reached its peak Intensity on 8 December. Soon after the Storm made Landfall at the same Intensity near Lagrange western Australia. Once inland Sam was slow to weaken as it recurved eastward and continued Inland for nearly a Week before dissipating on 14 December."
