short_summary: "Architectural style of Medieval Europe"
description: "Romanesque Architecture is an architectural Style of Medieval Europe that was predominant between the 11th and 12th Centuries. The Style eventually developed into the Gothic Style with the Shape of the Arches providing a simple Distinction: the Romanesque is characterized by semicircular Arches, while the Gothic is marked by the pointed Arches. The Romanesque emerged nearly simultaneously in multiple countries ; its examples can be found across the continent, making it the first pan-European architectural style since Imperial Roman architecture. Similarly to gothic the Name of the Style was transferred onto romanesque contemporary Art."
