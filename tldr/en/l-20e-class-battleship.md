Design Work on the Class of Battleship to succeed the bayern Class Battleships began in 1914 but the Outbreak of World War I in July 1914 led to this Plan being shelved. Work was resumed in early 1916 and Lessons from the Battle of Jutland later fought that Year were integrated into the Design. Reinhard scheer the Fleet Commander wanted larger main Guns and higher Top Speed than earlier Ships to combat the latest Ships in the british Royal Navy. A Variety of Proposals were submitted, with armament ranging from the same eight 38 Cm Guns of the Bayern Class to eight 42 Cm Guns."
