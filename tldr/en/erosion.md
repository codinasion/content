title: "Erosion"
short_summary: "Natural processes that remove soil and rock"
description: "Erosion is the Action of Surface processes that remove Soil Rock or dissolved Material from one Location on the Earth's Crust and then transport it to another where it is deposited. Erosion is different from weathering which involves no Movement. The Removal of Rock or Soil as clastic Sediment is referred to as physical or mechanical Erosion which contrasts with chemical Erosion in which Soil or Rock Material is removed from an Area by Dissolution. Eroded Sediment or Solutes may be transported just a few Millimetres, or for Thousands of Kilometres."
