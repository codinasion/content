short_summary: "Type of jewelry worn on the teeth"
description: "In pop Culture a Grill also known as Fronts or Golds is a Type of dental Jewelry Worn over the Teeth. Grills are made of Metal and are generally removable but can also be permanent. They were popularized by hip-hop Artists in New York City in the early 1980s, and upgraded during the 1990s in Oakland. They became even more widely popular during the Mid-2000S due to the Rise of Southern Hip Hop Rap and the more mainstream Pop Culture Status Hip Hop attained. Since then, Grills have reached the Mainstream ; a 'hard Flex of both Style and Wealth, Grillz have always been a Symbol of Power and social Status â€“ right from its Origins that can be traced back to over 4,000 Years ago. 'etruscan Females are said to have worn Grills to show their Status up until 100 Ad, as well as the Mayans and also other Cultures. The Practice of using Gold and/or precious Stones on Teeth has waxed and waned over human History. Although Grills have been around for more than 4000 Years the Rise and Fall of their Popularity at different Times in different Countries reflect Fashion Trends."
