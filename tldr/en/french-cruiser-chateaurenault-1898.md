short_summary: "Protected cruiser of the French Navy"
description: "Chteaurenault was a large protected Cruiser built in the late 1890S and early 1900s for the french Navy. She was intended to serve as a long-range Commerce Raider designed according to Theories of the Jeune Cole which favoured a Strategy of attacking Britain's extensive Merchant Shipping Network rather than engaging in an expensive Naval Arms Race with the Royal Navy. As such Chteaurenault was built with a relatively light Armament of just eight medium-caliber Guns but was given a long Cruising Range and the Appearance of a large Passenger Liner which would help her to evade Detection while."
