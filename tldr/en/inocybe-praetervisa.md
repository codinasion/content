short_summary: "Species of fungus"
description: "Inocybe Praetervisa is a small Yellow and brown Mushroom in the Family Inocybaceae that is distinguished by its unusual Spores and Bulb from other Members of the. The unusual Spores led to the Species being called the Type Species of the now-abandoned Genus Astrosporina recent Studies have shown that such a Genus can not exist as the Species with the defining Traits do not form a monophyletic. However, it is a Part of several Clades within the Genus Inocybe. I. Praetervisa Grows on Ground in Woodland favouring Beech Trees and is found in europe North America and Asia. It is inedible and probably poisonous due to the presence of muscarine. The Ingestion of Muscarine can lead to the Sludge Syndrome and potentially lead to Death due to respiratory Failure."
