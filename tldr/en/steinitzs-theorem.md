description: "In polyhedral Combinatorics a Branch of Mathematics is steinitz's Theorem a Characterization of the undirected Graphs formed by the Edges and Vertices of three-dimensional Convex polyhedra they are exactly 3-vertex-connected Plan. That is, every Convex Polyhedron forms a 3-connected Planar Graph, and every 3-connected Planar Graph can be represented as the Graph of a Convex Polyhedron. For this Reason the 3-connected Planar Graphs are also known as polyhedral Graphs."
