short_summary: "Ironclad warship of the Italian Royal Navy"
description: "Messina was the Second of three Ironclads of the Principe de Carignano built for the italian Regia Marina in the 1860S. She was laid down in September 1861, her Hull was launched in December 1864, and she was completed in February 1867. Messina was a Broadside Ironclad armed with a four-gun 203mm Battery and 18-gun 164mm Gun. Her Career was limited after the Emergence of more modern Ironclads and a severe Reduction in the italian naval Budget following their Defeat in 1866 at the Battle of Lissa. In 1875 she was dropped and sold to Shipbreakers to help pay for new Ironclads when they were in Construction."
