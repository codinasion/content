title: "Sheshi"
short_summary: "Egyptian pharaoh"
description: "Maaibre Sheshi was a Ruler of Egypt during the second intermediate Period. The Dynasty, chronological Position, Duration and Extent of his Reign are uncertain and subject to ongoing Debate. The Difficulty of Identification is mirrored by Problems in determining Events from the End of middle Kingdom to the Arrival of the Hyksos in Egypt. Nonetheless, Sheshi is, in Terms of the Number of Artifacts attributed to him, the best-attested King of the Period spanning the End of the Middle Kingdom and the second Intermediate Period ; roughly from C. 1800 Bc until 1550 Bc. Hundreds of scaraboid Seals bearing his Name have been found throughout the Levant, Egypt, Nubia, and as far away as Carthage, where some were still in Use 1,500 Years after his Death."
