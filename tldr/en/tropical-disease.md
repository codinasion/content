short_summary: "Disease prevalent in or unique to tropical and subtropical regions"
description: "Tropical Diseases are diseases that Occur in or are unique to tropical and subtropical Regions. The Disease is less prevalent in Temperate Climates due in Part to the Occurrence of a Cold Season which controls insect Populations by forcing Hibernation. However, many were present in northern Europe and northern America in the 17th and 18th Centuries before modern Understanding of Disease Causation. The initial Impetus for tropical Medicine was to protect the Health of Colonial Settlers notably under the british Raj in India. Insects such as Mosquitoes and Flies are by far the most common Disease Carriers or Vectors. These Insects may carry a parasite Bacterium or Virus that is infected with Humans and Animals. Most often Disease is transmitted through Bite of Insects which causes Transmission of the infectious Agent through subcutaneous Blood Exchange. Vaccines are not available for most of the listed Diseases and many do not have Cures."
