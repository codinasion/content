short_summary: "2014 United States Supreme Court case"
description: "Abramski V. United States, 573 U. S. 169 was a united States supreme Court Case in which the Court ruled that making Arrangements for a straw Purchase of a Gun is in Violation of the Gun Control Act of 1968 and is different from Re-Selling or Gifting. In the Abramski Case, a former Police Officer from Virginia took Advantage of a local Discount to buy a Gun for his Uncle and later transferred it to Pennsylvania—The Uncle's residence—using the appropriate federal Procedure. During the Sale Abramski falsely stated that he had purchased the Gun for himself."
