title: "Mu wave"
short_summary: "Electrical activity in the part of the brain controlling voluntary movement"
description: "The Sensorimotor Mu Rhythm, also known as Mu Wave, Comb or Wicket Rhythms or Arciform Rhythms, are synchronized Patterns of electrical Activity involving large Numbers of Neurons, probably of the Pyramidal Type, in the Part of the Brain that controls voluntary Movement. These Patterns measured by Electroencephalography Magnetoencephalography or Electrocorticography Repeat at a Frequency of 7. 5–12. 5 Hz, and are most prominent when the Body is physically at Rest. Unlike the Alpha Wave, which occurs at a similar Frequency over the resting visual Cortex at the Back of the Scalp, the Mu Rhythm is found over the Motor Cortex, in a Band approximately from ear to ear. People suppress mu Rhythms when they perform Motor Actions or, with Practice, when they visualize performing Motor Actions. This Suppression is called Desynchronization of the Wave because Eeg Wave Forms are caused by large Numbers of Neurons firing in Synch. The Mu Rhythm is even suppressed when one observes another Person performing a Motor Action or an abstract Motion with biological Characteristics. Researchers such as V. S. Ramachandran and Colleagues have suggested that this is a Sign that the Mirror Neuron System is involved in Mu Rhythm Suppression although Others disagree."
