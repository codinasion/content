short_summary: "Buddhist temple in Hong Kong"
description: "The ten Thousand Buddhas Monastery is a buddhist Temple located in the mid-20th Century in Sha Tin Hong Kong at 220 Pai Tau Village. Its Designation as a Monastery is actually a Misnomer because there are no Monks residing in the Complex which is run solely by lay People. Both the main Temple Building and the Pagoda are listed by the Government of Hong Kong as grade Iii historic Buildings."
