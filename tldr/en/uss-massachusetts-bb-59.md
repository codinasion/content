short_summary: "Fast battleship of the United States Navy"
description: "The uss Massachusetts is the third of four fast Battleships of the south dakota Class built in the late 1930S for the united States navy. The first american Battleships designed after the Washington Treaty System began to breakdown in the mid-'30s took Advantage of an Escalator Clause that allowed increasing the main Battery to 16-inch Guns but Refusal to authorize larger Battleships kept their Displacement close to the Washington Limit of 35000. A Requirement to be armored against the same Caliber of Guns as they carried coupled with the displacement Restriction resulted in cramped Ships a Problem which was further exacerbated by wartime Modifications that considerably reinforced their anti-aircraft Batteries and significantly increased their Crews."
