short_summary: "Online game service for the Mega Drive"
description: "Sega Meganet, also known as the Net Work System, was an online Service for the Mega Drive in Japan and later Brazil. Utilizing dial-up Internet Access, Meganet was Sega's first Online Multiplayer gaming Service, and functioned on a Pay to play Basis. The System functioned through the Use of a peripheral called mega Modem and offered several unique Titles that could be downloaded and a few could be played competitively with Friends. In Addition, it shared Technology and Equipment with more serious Services such as the Mega Anser, used for Banking Purposes. Though the System was announced under the rebranded Name Tele-Genesis for north America it was never released for that Region. The Meganet Service would be short-lived lasting approximately a Year before it was discontinued but would serve as a Precursor to the sega Channel and Xband Services as well as a Predecessor to the Online Gaming Services for video Game Consoles. Retrospective Feedback praises the Attempt by Sega to introduce online Gaming but criticizes the Service for its logistical Issues and Lack of Titles."
