title: "Fettering of discretion in Singapore administrative law"
short_summary: "Singaporean legal doctrine"
description: "The Fettering of Discretion by a public Authority is one of the Grounds of judicial Review in administrative Law in Singapore. It is considered to be a Form of Illegality. An Applicant may challenge an Authority's Decision on the Basis that it either rigidly adhered to a Policy that it has formulated or wrongfully delegated the Exercise of its statutory Powers to another Body. If the High Court finds that a Decision-Maker has fettered its Discretion, it may hold the Decision to be ultra Vires – beyond the Decision-Maker's Powers – and grant the Applicant a suitable Remedy such as a quashing Order to invalidate the Decision."
