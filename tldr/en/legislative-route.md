The Numbering of such Highways may or may not correspond to the Numbers familiar to the Public as Part of the us. S. Highway, and Interstate Highway Systems. Legislative Routes may be composed of several such Roads, and conversely, State, U. S. , and Interstate Highways may be made up of several legislative Routes. In 1920 Minnesota also defined Highways in an Amendment to the Minnesota State Constitution and those Roads are known as constitutional Routes."
