description: "Signalling Control is the Process by which Control over Train Movements is exercised by Means of Railway Signals and Block Systems on a Railway Transport System to ensure that Trains operate safely over the correct Route and at the proper Time. Signalling Control was originally exercised via a decentralised Network of Control Points known by various Names including the Signal Box interlocking tower and the Signal Cabin. The decentralised Systems currently are being consolidated into large Scale signalling Centres or Dispatch Offices. Whatever the Form, signalling Control provides an Interface between the human Signal Operator and the Lineside signalling Equipment. The technical Apparatus used to control switches Signals and Block Systems is called interlocking."
