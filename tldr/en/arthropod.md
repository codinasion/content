short_summary: "Phylum of invertebrates with jointed exoskeletons"
description: "Arthropods are Invertebrates in the Phylum Arthropoda. They possess an Exoskeleton with a Cuticle made of Chitin, often mineralised with Calcium Carbonate, a Body with differentiated Segments, and paired jointed Appendages. In Order to keep growing, they must go through Stages of Moulting, a Process by which they shed their Exoskeleton to reveal a new one. They are an extremely diverse group, with up to 10Â million species."
