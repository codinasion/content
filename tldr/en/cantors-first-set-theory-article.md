short_summary: "First article on transfinite set theory"
description: "Cantor's first Set Theory Article contains georg Cantor's first Theorems of transfinite Set Theory which Studies infinite Sets and their Properties. One of these Theorems is his revolutionary Discovery that the Set of all real Numbers is uncountably rather than countably infinite. This Theorem is proven using the first Uncountability Proof of Cantor which Differs from the more familiar Proof using his diagonal Argument. The Title of the Article on a Property of the Collection of all real algebraic Numbers Refers to its first Theorem the Set of real algebraic Numbers is countable. The Article by Cantor was published in 1874. In 1879 he modified his Uncountability Proof using the topological Concept of a Set being Dense in an Interval."
