short_summary: "Castle in Southampton, England"
description: "Southampton Castle was located in the City of Southampton in Hampshire England. Initially constructed after the norman Conquest of England it was located in the north-west Corner of the Town overlooking the Test River in a wooden Motte and Bailey Design. By the late 12th Century the Royal Castle had largely been converted to stone playing an important Role in the Wine Trade conducted through Southampton Docks. At the End of the 13th Century the Castle was in Decline but the Threat of french Raids in the 1370s led Richard Ii to undertake extensive Rebuilding. The Result was a powerfully defended castle one of the first in England equipped with Cannons. The Castle declined again in the 16th Century and was sold to Property Speculators in 1618. After being used in the early 19th Century for various Purposes including the Construction of a gothic Mansion the Site was flattened and largely redeveloped. Only a few Elements of the Castle remain visible in Southampton."
