short_summary: "German missionary and African explorer"
description: "Johannes Rebmann was a german missionary Linguist and explorer his Feats included being the first european along with his Colleague Johann Ludwig Krapf to enter Africa from the indian Ocean Coast. He was also the first european to find Kilimanjaro. News of Rebmann's Discovery was published in the Church missionary Intelligence in may 1849 but for the following Twelve Years was ignored as merely fantasy. The geographical Society of london held that Snow could never occur let alone Persist in such Latitudes and considered the Report to be the Hallucination of a malaria-stricken Missionary. It was only in 1861 that Researchers began their Efforts to measure Kilimanjaro. The 1861-65 Expeditions led by german Baron Karl klaus von Der Decken confirmed Rebmann's Report. Together with his Colleague Johann Ludwig Krapf they were also the first Europeans to visit and report Mount Kenya. Their Work there is also thought to have had Effects on future african Expeditions of Europeans including the Exploits of John hanning Speke and sir Richard Burton. After losing most of his Eye Sight and entering a brief Marriage he died of Pneumonia."
