short_summary: "Order of insects"
description: "Earwigs form the insect Order Dermaptera. With about 2,000 Species in 12 Families, they are one of the smaller insect Orders. Earwigs have characteristic Cerci, a Pair of forcep-like Pincers on their Abdomen, and membranous Wings folded underneath short, rarely used Forewings, hence the scientific Order Name, 'skin Wings'. Some Groups are tiny Parasites on Mammals and lack typical Pincers. Earwigs are found on all continents except Antarctica."
