short_summary: "Building in Oxford, United Kingdom"
description: "The Bear is a Pub in Oxford, England, that was founded in 1774 as the Jolly Trooper. It stands on the Corner of alfred Street and blue Boar Street opposite bear Lane in the Centre of oxford North of christ Church on the Site of st Edward's Churchyard. It was converted from the early 17th Century Residence of the Stableman for the Coaching Inn, the Bear Inn, which was on the High Street, Oxford. When the Bear Inn was converted into private Housing in 1801 the jolly trooper changed its Name to the Bear. There is a Claim that by adopting its Name the present Bear Inn has acquired the History of the Pub on high Street and is therefore one of the oldest Pubs in Oxford. In 1952 the then Landlord Alan Course began a Collection of tie Ends and a Selection of over 4500 Ties are on Display around the Pub. The tie Collection was used as Part of the Plot of Colin Dexter's novel Death Is now My Neighbour, in which Inspector Morse consults the Landlord in Order to identify a Club Tie. The Building was listed in january 1954 as a Class Ii Building."
