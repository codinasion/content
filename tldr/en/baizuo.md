short_summary: "Derogatory Chinese term: Western leftism"
description: "Baizuo is a derogatory chinese Neologism used to refer to western Liberals and Leftists and to their Values particularly in Relation to Refugees and social Problems. The Term originated in the 2010s, probably initially to mock American and western Communists who traveled to China to support the Communist Revolution and has since come into widespread Use due to chinese Netizens' Criticism of western liberal to leftist Ideologies and of european Governments, particularly Angela Merkel and the german Government, for their alleged Over-Tolerance during the Refugee Crisis, and to Netizens' Praise of Donald Trump's populist Policies. The Term has begun to be widely used in english as well most notably by american Conservatives."
