description: "The 2011-12 Columbus blue Jackets Season was the 12th Season of the Team in the national Hockey League. The Blue Jackets' Record of 29–46–7 was the worst Record in the Nhl for 2011–12 and the first Time in franchise History they finished in last Place. It was also the third straight Year in which they missed the Playoffs. In Consequence they had the best Chance of receiving the first overall Selection in the 2012 nhl Entry Draft Lottery but lost out to the Edmonton Oilers and received the second Pick instead."
