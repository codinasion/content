short_summary: "Extinct family of mammals"
description: "Trapalcotherium is a fossil Mammal of the cretaceous of Argentina in the ferugliotheriidae Family. The single species, T. Matuastensis, is known from one Tooth, a first lower Molar. It is from the Allen Formation which is probably maastrichtian in Age and was first described in 2009. The tooth Bears two Rows of Cusps one at the inner Side and the other at the outer Side that are connected by Transverse Ridges separated by deep Valleys. This Pattern is reminiscent of Ferugliotherium, a gondwanathere Mammal from similarly aged Deposits in Argentina, and Trapalcotherium is therefore recognized as a Member of the same Family Ferugliotheriidae. Ferugliotheriidae is one of two Families of Gondwanatheres, an enigmatic Group without close Relationships to any Living Mammals."
