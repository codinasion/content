short_summary: "Torpedo scout aircraft proposed for the US Navy in 1944"
description: "The Grumman Xtsf was a proposed Twin-Engine Torpedo Scout Aircraft designed by Grumman for the united States navy toward the End of World War Ii. Based on the Design of the Grumman f7f tigercat Fighter but expanded and with the Addition of a Bomb bay the Xtsf was deemed too large for Carrier Operations and the Project was cancelled before any Aircraft were built. Instead the navy ordered the single Engine Xtb3F which became the successful Af Guardian."
