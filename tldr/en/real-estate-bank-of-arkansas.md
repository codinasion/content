short_summary: "Bank in 19th-century Arkansas"
description: "The real Estate Bank of Arkansas was a Bank in Arkansas during the 1830s to 1850s. The Bank was founded in 1836 with Accusations of Waste and Favoritism as well as Violations of its legal Charter. In 1839 the Bank suspended specie Payments to allow it to lend more Money. Paper Money issued by the Bank lost Value and the Bank entered Trusteeship in 1842. An Act of the Arkansas Legislature approved of the Transfer to the Trustees in 1843, but the Trustees did not forward Information to the State and personally benefited from the Arrangement. In 1853 the arkansas Legislature passed a Bill which would have the Arkansas Attorney general Bring the Bank into the Chancery Court the Filing could not be made until 1854 due to lack of Cooperation from the Trustees. The Bank's Assets were transferred to the State in April 1855 and the first full public Accounting of the Bank's Finances was made in 1856. The Bonds related to the Bank were not fully extinguished until 1894 and a Portion of them known as Holford Bonds proved particularly problematic."
