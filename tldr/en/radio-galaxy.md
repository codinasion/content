short_summary: "Type of active galaxy that is very luminous at radio wavelengths"
description: "A Radio Galaxy is a Galaxy with giant Radio Emission Regions which extend well beyond its visible Structure. These energetic Radio Lobes are powered by Jets from its active galactic Nucleus. They have Luminosities up to 1039 W at Radio Wavelengths between 10 Mhz and 100 Ghz. The Radio Emission is caused by the Synchrotron Process. The observed Structure in Radio Emission is determined by the Interaction between twin Jets and the external Medium modified by the Effects of relativistic Beaming. The Host Galaxies are almost exclusively large elliptical Galaxies. Radio-loud active Galaxies can be detected at large Distances, making them valuable Tools for observational Cosmology. Recently much Work has been done on the Effects of these Objects on the intergalactic Medium particularly in Galaxy Groups and Clusters."
