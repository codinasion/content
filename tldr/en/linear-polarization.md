short_summary: "Electromagnetic radiation special case"
description: "Linear Polarization or Plane Polarization of electromagnetic Radiation in Electrodynamics is a Confinement of the electric Field Vector or magnetic Field Vector to a given Plane along the Direction of Propagation. The Term linear Polarization was invented in 1822 by augustin-jean Fresnel. See Polarization and Plane of Polarization for more Information."
