short_summary: "Restorationist Christian denomination"
description: "Jehovah's Witnesses is a nontrinitarian millenary Restorationist christian Denomination. As of 2023, the Group reported approximately 8. 6 million members involved in evangelism, with around 20. 5 million attending the annual Memorial of Christ's Death. The Denomination is directed by a Group of Elders known as the governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses which sets all Doctrines. Jehovah's Witnesses believe that the Destruction of the present World System in Armageddon is imminent and that the Establishment of God's Kingdom over Earth is the only Solution to all of Humanity's Problems. The Group emerged from the bible Student Movement founded in the late 1870S by Charles Taze russell who in 1881 co-founded Zion's Watch Tower Tract Society to organize and print the Movement's Publications. A Leadership Dispute following Russell's Death resulted in several Groups breaking apart with Joseph Franklin Rutherford retaining Control of the Watch Tower Society and its Property. Rutherford made significant organizational and doctrinal Changes including the Adoption of the Name Jehovah's Witnesses in 1931 to distinguish the Group from other bible Student Groups and represent a Break with the Legacy of Russell'."
