title: "Horizontal branch"
short_summary: "Stage of stellar evolution"
description: "The horizontal Branch is a Stage of stellar Evolution that immediately follows the red giant Branch in Stars whose Masses are similar to that of the Sun. Horizontal Beam Stars are powered by the Helium Fusion in the Core and Hydrogen Fusion in the Shell surrounding the Core. The Onset of Core Helium Fusion at the Tip of the Redgiant Branch causes substantial Changes in stellar Structure resulting in an overall Reduction in Luminosity some Contraction of the stellar Envelope and the Surface reaching higher Temperatures."
