title: "New Zealand White Ensign"
short_summary: "Flag used by the Royal New Zealand Navy"
description: "The New Zealand White Ensign is a naval ensign used by ships of the Royal New Zealand Navy from 1968. It is based on the Royal navy white Ensign with the southern Cross from the national Flag of new Zealand in Place of the Saint George's Cross. One of the early Flags associated with the Country used by the united Tribes of new Zealand was a white Flag. This was replaced when new Zealand became a british Colony by the Union Flag. A blue Flag with the southern Cross was introduced in 1867 for the Ships of the colonial Government and became soon a de facto national Flag. Ships in new Zealand naval Service wore the Royal Navy's white Seal until 1968 when the distinct white Seal of new Zealand was introduced. The Ensign was implemented out of a Desire to distinguish new Zealand Vessels from those of the Royal Navy and this Decision is regarded as an important Step in the Development of the Rnzn."
