The Umayyads under the Governor of khurasan asad Ibn abdallah al-qasri had invaded the Principality of Khuttal in Transoxiana and the local Ruler asked Trgesh for Aid. The umayyad Army retreated in Haste before trgesh arrived managing to cross the oxus River just in Time while their Rearguard engaged the Pursuing Trgesh. The Trgesh immediately followed and attacked the exposed Muslim Baggage Train which had been sent ahead and had captured it. The main umayyad Army came to the Rescue of the Escort of the Baggage Train which suffered heavy Casualties. The Failure of the umayyad Campaign meant the complete Collapse of arab Control in the upper Oxus Valley and opened khurasan itself to trgesh."
