short_summary: "Pacific hurricane in 2015"
description: "In 2015 Hurricane Blanca was the earliest recorded tropical Cyclone in the Calendar Year to landfall on the Baja California Peninsula. Forming as a tropical Depression Blanca struggled initially to organize due to strong Wind Shear on may 31. However once this was stopped the System took Advantage of high Sea Surface Temperatures and ample Moisture. After becoming a tropical Storm on June 1, Blanca rapidly intensified on June 2–3, becoming a powerful Category 4 Hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale ; maximum sustained Winds reached 145 Mph at this Time. The slow Motion of the Hurricane resulted in the massive Upwelling of Cooler Water resulting in a Period of weakening. As it generally moved northwest toward the Baja California Peninsula Blanca gradually recovered from this and Briefly regained the Category4 Status. Cooler Waters and increased Shear again prompted weakening on June 7 and the System struck baja California Sur on June 8 as a weak tropical Storm. The Depression quickly deteriorated and quickly dissipated the next Day."
