description: "The Siege of Shaizar took Place from 28 April to 21 may 1138. The allied Forces of the Byzantine Empire of the Principality of Antioch and the County of Edessa invaded muslim Syria. Having been repulsed from their main Objective, the City of Aleppo, the combined Christian Armies took a Number of fortified Settlements by Assault and finally besieged Shaizar, the Capital of the Munqidhite Emirate. The Siege captured the City but failed to take the Citadel it resulted in the Emir of Shaizar paying an Indemnity and becoming the Vassal of the Byzantine Emperor. The Forces of Zengi the greatest muslim Prince of the Region fought the allied Army but it was too strong for them to risk a Battle. The Campaign stressed the limited Nature of byzantine Suzerainty over the northern Crusader States and the Lack of common Purpose between the latin Princes and the Byzantine Emper."
