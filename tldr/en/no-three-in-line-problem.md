title: "No-three-in-line problem"
short_summary: "Geometry problem on grid points"
description: "The no three-in-line Problem in discrete Geometry asks how many Points can be placed in a Grid so that no three Points lie on the same Line. The Problem concerns all Slopes not only those aligned with the Grid. In 1900 it was introduced by Henry Dudeney. Brass Moser and Pach Call this one of the oldest and most extensively studied geometric Questions about Lattice Points."
