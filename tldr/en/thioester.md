short_summary: "Organosulfur compounds of the form R–SC(=O)–R’"
description: "In organic Chemistry Thioesters are organosulfur Compounds with the molecular Structure Rcsr. They are analogous to carboxylate esters with the sulfur in the thioester replacing oxygen in the carboxylate ester, as implied by the thio- prefix. They are the Result of Esterification of a carboxylic Acid with Thiol. In Biochemistry the most known Thioesters are Derivatives of Coenzyme a E. G. Acetyl Coa. The R and R' Represent Organyl Groups, or H in the Case of R."
