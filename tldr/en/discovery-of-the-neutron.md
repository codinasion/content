short_summary: "Scientific background leading to the discovery of subatomic particles"
description: "The discovery of the neutron and its properties was central to the extraordinary developments in atomic physics in the first half of the 20th century. Early in the Century ernest Rutherford developed a Crude Atom Model based on the Gold Foil Experiment of Hans Geiger and ernest Marsden. In this Model Atoms had their Mass and positive electric Charge concentrated in a very small Nucleus. By 1920 Isotopes of Chemical Elements had been discovered the atomic Masses had been determined to be integer Multiples of the Mass of the Hydrogen Atom and the atomic Number had been identified as the Charge at the Nucleus. Throughout the 1920s the Nucleus was viewed as composed of Combinations of Protons and Electrons the two elementary Particles known at the Time but that model displayed several experimental and theoretical Contradictions."
