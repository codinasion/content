short_summary: "Digital entertainment in which the storyline is not predetermined"
description: "Interactive Storytelling is a Form of digital Entertainment in which the Storyline is not predetermined. The Author creates the Setting, Characters, and Situation which the Narrative must address, but the User experiences a unique Story based on their Interactions with the Story World. The Architecture of an interactive Storytelling Program includes a Drama Manager, User Model, and agent Model to control, respectively, Aspects of narrative Production, Player Uniqueness, and Character Knowledge and Behavior. Together, these Systems generate Characters that act 'human,' alter the World in real-time Reactions to the Player, and ensure that new narrative Events unfold comprehensibly."
