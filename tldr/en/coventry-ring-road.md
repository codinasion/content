description: "The A4053 Coventry ring Road is a 2. 25-mile ring Road in Coventry, England, which forms a complete Dual-Carriageway Loop around the City Centre. The Road encompasses the old and new Coventry Cathedrals, the City's Shopping Areas and much of Coventry University. With the exception of one roundabout at junction 1, the ring road's nine junctions are entirely grade separated and closely spaced, with weaving sections between them, some as short as 300 yards , giving the road a reputation for being difficult to navigate. The Junctions include Connections with three other a Roads: the A4114, A4600 and A429."
