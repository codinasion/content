short_summary: "Pacific typhoon in 1980"
description: "Typhoon Kim known as Typhoon Osang in the Philippines was the second Typhoon in a Week to affect the Philippines directly during July 1980. Like Typhoon Joe Kim formed on July 19th from the near equatorial Monsoon Trough in the northwestern Pacific Ocean. The Disturbance tracked quickly west-northwest under a subtropical Ridge reaching tropical Storm Strength on the 21st and typhoon Strength on the 23rd. Kim began to rapidly intensify after developing an Eye and peaked as a super Typhoon during the Afternoon of July 24. Several Hours later kim made Landfall over the Philippines but the Storm had weakened considerably by this Time. Throughout the Philippines, 40 People were killed, 2 via Drownings, and 19,000 Others were directly affected. A total of 12,000 homes were destroyed and 5,000 villages were flooded. Less than a Week earlier, the same Areas were affected by Joe ; however, Kim was considered the more Damaging of the two Typhoons. Land Interaction took its Toll on Kim and upon entering the south China sea the Storm was below Typhoon Intensity. Kim continued northwest but its interrupted Circulation prevented Re-Intensification and it remained a tropical Storm until hitting southern China on July 27 to the Northeast of Hong Kong where only slight Damage was reported. Later that Day, Kim dissipated."
