short_summary: "Literary works written in the English language"
description: "English Literature is literature written in the english Language of the english Speaking World. Over the Course of more than 1400 Years the english Language evolved. The earliest Forms of english a Set of anglo-frisian Dialects brought to great Britain by anglo-saxon Invaders in the fifth Century are called old English. Beowulf is the most famous Work in old English and has achieved national Epic Status in England despite being set in Scandinavia. However following the norman Conquest of England in 1066 the written Form of the anglo-saxon Language became less common. Under the Influence of the new Aristocracy, french became the standard Language of Courts, Parliament, and polite Society. The english Spoken after the Normans came is known as middle English. This Form of English lasted until the 1470S, when the Chancery Standard, a london-based Form of English, became widespread. Geoffrey Chaucer Author of the Canterbury Tales was a significant Figure in the Development of the Legitimacy of the vernacular middle English at a Time when the dominant literary Languages in England were still french and latin. The Invention of the Printing Press by Johannes Gutenberg in 1439 helped also to standardise the Language as did the King James bible and the great Vowel Shift."
