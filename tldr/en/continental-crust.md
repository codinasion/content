title: "Continental crust"
short_summary: "Layer of rock that forms the continents and continental shelves"
description: "The continental Crust is the Layer of metamorphic and sedimentary igneous Rocks that form the geological Continents and the shallow Seabeds close to their Shores known as continental Shelves. This Layer is sometimes called sial because its Bulk Composition is richer in Aluminium Silicates and has a lower Density compared to oceanic Crust called Sima which is richer in Magnesium Silicate Minerals. Changes in seismic Wave Velocities have shown that at a certain Depth there is a reasonably strong Contrast between the more felsic upper Continental Crust and the lower Continental Crust which is more mafic in Character."
