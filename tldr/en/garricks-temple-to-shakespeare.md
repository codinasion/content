description: "Garrick's Temple to shakespeare is a small Garden folly erected on the north Bank of the Thames in Hampton in the london Borough of Richmond upon Thames in 1756. It was built by the Actor David Garrick to honour the Playwright William Shakespeare whose Plays garrick performed to great Acclaim throughout his Career. During his Lifetime Garrick used it to House his extensive Collection of shakespearean Relics and for entertaining his Family and Guests. It passed through a Succession of Owners until it came into public Ownership in the 1930s but fell into serious Disrepair by the End of the 20th Century. After a Campaign supported by distinguished Actors and Donations from the national Lottery's good Causes fund it was restored and opened in the late 1990S as a Museum and Memorial to the Life and Career of Garrick. It is reputedly the world's only shrine to Shakespeare."
