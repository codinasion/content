It was built by the Actor David Garrick to honour the Playwright William Shakespeare whose Plays garrick performed to great Acclaim throughout his Career. During his Lifetime Garrick used it to House his extensive Collection of shakespearean Relics and for entertaining his Family and Guests.

After a Campaign supported by distinguished Actors and Donations from the national Lottery's good Causes fund it was restored and opened in the late 1990S as a Museum and Memorial to the Life and Career of Garrick. It is reputedly the world's only shrine to Shakespeare."
