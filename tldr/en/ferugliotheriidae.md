description: "Ferugliotheriidae is one of three known Families in the Order Gondwanatheria, an enigmatic Group of extinct Mammals. Gondwanatheres have been classified as a Group of uncertain Affinities or as Members of the Multituberculata a major extinct mammalian Order. The most known Representative of the Ferugliotheriidae is the genus Ferugliotherium from the late cretaceous Epoch in Argentina. A second Genus, Trapalcotherium, is known from a single Tooth, a first lower Molariform, from a different Late Cretaceous Argentinean Locality. Another Genus known from a single Tooth, Argentodites, was first described as an unrelated Multituberculate, but later identified as possibly related to Ferugliotherium. Finally, a single Tooth from the Paleogene of Peru, Lacm 149371, perhaps a last upper Molariform, and a recent Specimen from Mexico, may represent related Animals."
