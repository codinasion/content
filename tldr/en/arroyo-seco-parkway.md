short_summary: "Highway in California"
description: "The Arroyo Seco Parkway also known as the Pasadena Freeway is one of the oldest Freeways constructed in the united States. The Parkway connects los Angeles with pasadena beside the seasonal River Arroyo Seco. It is not only noted for being an early Freeway mostly opened in 1940 but also for representing the transitional Phase between early Parkways and later Freeways. It conformed to modern Standards when it was built but is now viewed as a narrow old Road. A 1953 Extension brought the south End to the four Level Interchange in downtown Los Angeles and a Connection with the Rest of the Freeway System."
