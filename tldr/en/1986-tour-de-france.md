short_summary: "Cycling race"
description: "The Tour de France 1986 was a Cycling Race that took Place from 4 July to 27 July in France. It was the 73rd Tour de France. Greg Lemond from la vie Claire won the Race ahead of his Teammate Bernard Hinault. It was the first Victory for a Rider outside of Europe. Five-time Tour Winner Hinault, who had won the Year before with Lemond supporting him, had publicly pledged to ride in Support of Lemond in 1986. Several Attacks during the Race cast Doubt on the Sincerity of his Promise leading to a Rift between the two Riders and the entire La Vie Claire Team. The Tour de France of 1986 is widely considered to be one of the most memorable Moments in the Sport's History due to the Battle between Lemond and Hinault."
