short_summary: "1995 book by Daniel Dennett"
description: "Darwin's dangerous Idea Evolution and the Meanings of Life is a Book by Philosopher Daniel Dennett in 1995 in which the Author looks at some of the Repercussions of Darwin's Theory. The Crux of the Argument is that whether or not darwin's Theories are overturned there is no going back from the dangerous Idea that Design might not need a Designer. Dennett has argued this Case on the Basis that natural Selection is a blind Process but is nevertheless sufficiently powerful to explain the Evolution of Life. Darwin's Discovery was that the Generation of Life worked algorithmically, that processes behind it work in such a Way that given these processes the Results that they tend toward must be so."
