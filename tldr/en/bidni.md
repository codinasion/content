short_summary: "Olive cultivar from Malta"
description: "The Bidni also known as Bitni is an olive Cultivar from the mediterranean Island of Malta. The Fruit is small in Size, Hearty with a 'Violet Colour', and is renowned for its superior Oil which is low in Acidity. The Latter is generally attributed to poor Quality Alkaline Soil on the maltese Islands. As an indigenous olive Cultivar, the Bidni has developed a unique Dna Profile, and is believed to be among the most ancient Species on the Island, triggering local Authorities to declare some of these ancient Trees as 'national Monuments', and as having an 'antiquarian Importance', a Status which is enjoyed by only a Handful of other Species."
