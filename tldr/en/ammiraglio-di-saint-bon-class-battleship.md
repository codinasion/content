The Class comprised two Ships: Ammiraglio di Saint Bon, the Lead Ship, and Emanuele Filiberto. They were armed with a main Battery of four 254mm Guns and could reach a top Speed of 18 Knots. They were smaller and less powerfully-armed than most contemporary Battleships marking a brief Departure from italian Capital Ship Design which had previously emphasized large Ships with large Guns."
