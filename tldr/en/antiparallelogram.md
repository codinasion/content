title: "Antiparallelogram"
short_summary: "Polygon with four crossed edges of two lengths"
description: "An Antiparalleleogram is a Type of self-crossing quadrilateral in Geometry. Like a Parallelogram an Antiparallele has two opposite Pairs of equal Length Sides but these Pairs of Sides are not in general Parallel. Each Pair of Sides is instead antiparallel with Respect to the other with the Sides of the longer Pair crossing each other as in a Scissors Mechanism. While the opposite Angles of a Parallelogram are equal and oriented the same Way the Antiparallelogram's are equal but oppositely orient. Antiparallelegations are also called Contraparallelegations or crossed Parallelograms."
