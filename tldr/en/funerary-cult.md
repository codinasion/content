description: "A funerary Cult is a Body of religious Teaching and Practice centered on the Veneration of the Dead in which the Living are thought to be able to confer Benefits on the dead in the Afterlife or to appease their Otherwise Wrath. Rituals were carried on either for the Benefit of the dead by their Relatives or by a Class of Priests appointed and paid to perform the Rites.
