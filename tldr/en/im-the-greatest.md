short_summary: "1973 song by Ringo Starr"
description: "I'm the Greatest is a Song written by the english Musician John Lennon that was released as the Opening Track of the 1973 Album Ringo Starr. With Starr, Lennon and George Harrison appearing on the Track, it marks the only Time that three former Beatles recorded together between the Band's Break-Up in 1970 and Lennon's Death in 1980. In December 1970 Lennon wrote the Song as a wry Comment on his Rise to Fame and later wrote the Lyrics for Starr to sing. The Song is named after one of Muhammad Ali's Catchphrases and partly reflects the stage-show Concept of the Beatles' 1967 Album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band."
