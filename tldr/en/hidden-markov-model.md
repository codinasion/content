short_summary: "Statistical Markov model"
description: "A hidden Markov Model is a markov Model in which Observations depend on a latent Markov Process. An Hmm requires a observable Process whose Outcomes are dependent on the Results in a known Way. Since can not be observed directly the Goal is to learn about the State of by observing by Definition of being a Markov Model an Hmm has an additional Requirement that the Outcome of at Time must be influenced exclusively by the Outcome of at and the Outcomes of and at must be conditionally independent of. The Baumwelch Algorithm can be used to estimate the Parameters for linear Chain Hmms."
