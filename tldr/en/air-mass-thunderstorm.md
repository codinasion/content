short_summary: "Thunderstorm that is generally weak and usually not severe"
description: "An air-mass Thunderstorm also called an ordinary isolated single Cell Thunderstorm or a garden Variety Thunderstorm is a Thunderstorm that is generally weak and usually not severe. These Storms form in Environments where at least some Amount of convective available potential Energy is present but with very low Levels of Wind Shear and Helicity. The Lifting Source which is a crucial Factor in Thunderstorm Development is usually the Result of uneven Heating of the Surface though they can be induced by Weather Fronts and other low-level Boundaries associated with Wind Convergence. The Energy needed for these Storms to form comes in the Form of Insolation or solar Radiation. Air-Mass Thunderstorms do not move quickly, last no longer than an Hour, and have the Threats of Lightning, as well as Showery Light, moderate, or heavy Rainfall. Heavy Rain can interfere with microwave Transmissions in the Atmosphere."
