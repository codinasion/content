short_summary: "Cells that ingest harmful matter within the body"
description: "Phagocytes are Cells that protect the Body by ingesting harmful foreign Particles, Bacteria, and dead or dying Cells. Their Name comes from the Greek Phagein, 'to eat' or 'Devour', and '-Cyte', the Suffix in Biology denoting 'Cell', from the Greek Kutos, 'hollow Vessel'. They are essential for tackling Infections and later acquiring Immunity. Phagocytes are important throughout the animal Kingdom and are highly developed in Vertebrates. One Litre of human Blood Contains about six billion Phagocytes. They were discovered by Ilya ilyich Mechnikov in 1882 while studying starfish Larvae. For his Discovery Mechnikov was awarded the nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1908. Phagocytes occur in many Species some amoebae behave like Macrophage Phagocytes which suggests Phagocytes appeared early in Life."
