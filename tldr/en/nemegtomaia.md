title: "Nemegtomaia"
short_summary: "Extinct genus of dinosaurs"
description: "Nemegtomaia is a Genus of oviraptorid Dinosaurs from what is now mongolia that lived in the late cretaceous Period about 70million Years ago. The first Specimen was found in 1996 and became the Base of the new Species and Genus N. Barsboldi in 2004. The original Genus Name was nemegtia but it was changed to nemegtomaia in 2005 as the former Name was preoccupied. The first Part of the generic Name Refers to the Nemegt Basin where the Animal was found and the second Part means good Mother in Reference to the Fact that Oviraptorids are known to have brooded. The specific Name honors the Palaeontologist Rinchen Barsbold. Two more Specimens were found in 2007, one of which was found on Top of a Nest with Eggs, but the Dinosaur had received its Genus Name before it was found associated with Eggs."
