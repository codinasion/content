description: "The 2016 Fia Gt World Cup was a grand Touring Sports Car Race held on 20 november 2016 in the Streets of the autonomous Province of Macau. It was the second annual Edition of the Event and the ninth Time that gt3-specified Machinery had participated in Macau. Unlike the 2015 Race it was not run as a non-championship Gt Asia Series Race. The Automobile General Association Macau-China appointed Motorsports organiser Stéphane Ratel Organisation to help form a Grid. The Race itself consisted of two Races - a twelve-lap Qualification Race that determined the starting Grid for the four-lap main Race."
