short_summary: "Lost city in Nome VIII of Upper Egypt, Ancient Egypt"
description: "Thinis was the Capital of upper Egypt before the Unification. Thinis remains undiscovered but is well attested by ancient writers, including the classical historian Manetho, who cites it as the centre of the Thinite Confederacy, a tribal confederation whose leader, Menes, united Egypt and was its first pharaoh. Thinis began a steep Decline in Importance when the Capital was relocated to memphis which was thought to be the first true and stable Capital after the Unification of Egypt by Menes. The Location of Thinis on the Border of the competing Heracleopolitan and theban Dynasties of the first intermediate Period and its Proximity to certain Oases of possible military Importance provided Thinis some continued Importance in the old and new Kingdoms. This was a brief Respite and Thinis eventually lost its Position as a regional administrative Centre by the Roman Period."
