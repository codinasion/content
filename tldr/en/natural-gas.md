short_summary: "Gaseous fossil fuel"
description: "Natural Gas is a naturally occurring Mixture of gaseous Hydrocarbons composed mostly of Methane in Addition to various smaller Amounts of other higher Alkanes. Low Levels of Trace Gases such as Carbon Dioxide Nitrogen Hydrogen Sulfide and Helium are also usually present. Methane is colorless and odorless and the second largest Greenhouse Gas contributing to global Climate Change after Carbon Dioxide. Because natural Gas is odorless Odorizers such as Mercaptan are often added to it for Safety so leaks can be easily detected."
