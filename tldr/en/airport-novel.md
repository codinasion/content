title: "Airport novel"
short_summary: "Type of genre fiction novel"
description: "The Airport Novel represents a literary Genre which is not so much defined by its Plot or the Cast of Stock Characters but by the social Function it serves. Designed to meet the Demands of a very specific Market, Airport Novels are superficially engaging while not being necessarily profound, usually written to be more entertaining than philosophically challenging. An Airport Novel is typically a fairly long but fast-paced Boilerplate Genre-Fiction Novel commonly offered by Airport Newsstands, 'read for Pace and Plot, not Elegance of phrasing'."
