description: "The 55th Boat Race took Place on March 24 1898. The Boat Race is held every Year to a side-by-side Rowing Race among the renowned University Teams of Oxford and Cambridge along the Thames. Oxford, the Reigning Champions and leading overall, went into the Race with a marginally heavier Crew than Cambridge. They won quickly as Cambridge's Boat became waterlogged in strong Winds and inclement Conditions. It was their ninth consecutive Victory and took them to an overall Lead of 32â€“22 in the Event. The winning Time of 22 Minutes 15 Seconds was the slowest Time since the 1878 Race."
