description: "Little Moreton Hall also known as old Moreton Hall is a moated half-timbered Manor House 4. 5 Miles south-west of Congleton in Cheshire England. The earliest Parts of the House were built for the prosperous Cheshire Landowner William Moreton in about 1504â€“08 and the Remainder was constructed in Stages by successive Generations of the Family until about 1610. The Building is highly irregular with three asymmetrical Ranges forming a small Rectangular cobbled Courtyard. A National Trust Guidebook describes Little Moreton Hall as being 'lifted straight from a fairy Story, a gingerbread House. The House's top-heavy Appearance like a trapped Noah's Ark is due to the long Gallery that runs the Length of the upper Floor of the south Range."
