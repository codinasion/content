description: "Little Moreton Hall also known as old Moreton Hall is a moated half-timbered Manor House 4. 5 Miles south-west of Congleton in Cheshire England. The earliest Parts of the House were built for the prosperous Cheshire Landowner William Moreton in about 1504–08 and the Remainder was constructed in Stages by successive Generations of the Family until about 1610. The Building is highly irregular with three asymmetrical Ranges forming a small Rectangular cobbled Courtyard. A National Trust Guidebook describes Little Moreton Hall as being 'lifted straight from a fairy Story, a gingerbread House. The House's top-heavy Appearance like a trapped Noah's Ark is due to the long Gallery that runs the Length of the upper Floor of the south Range."
