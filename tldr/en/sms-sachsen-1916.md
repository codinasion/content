short_summary: "Battleship of the German Imperial Navy"
description: "Sms Sachsen was the third of four dreadnought-type german Battleships built but never finished in the 1910s for the german Kaiserliche Marine. This Ship is sometimes considered to be Part of a Subclass with her Sister Wrttemberg. Like the other Members of the Class she was armed with the same main Battery of eight 38 Mm Guns in four Gun Turrets but she differed in her Propulsion System from the other Members of. She replaced the Steam Turbine on the Center Propeller Shaft in Favour of Diesel Engines. She was laid down in April 1914 at the Germaniawerft Shipyard, but the Start of World War i in July slowed Work on the Ship ; she was launched in November 1916, but as Resources were diverted to more pressing Projects, including u-boat Construction, Work stopped completely when the Ship was about nine Months from Completion. Some Components of her Propulsion System were reused in several Type u 151 Submarines. The Treaty of Versailles which ended the War in June 1919 specified that all Warships under Construction in Germany were to be destroyed and sachsen was thus sold for Scrap in 1920 and dismantled the following Year."
