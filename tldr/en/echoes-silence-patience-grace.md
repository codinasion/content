It also marks the second Time the Band worked with Producer Gil Norton, whom Frontman Dave Grohl brought to fully explore the Potential of his Compositions and have a Record that sounded different from their previous Work. Grohl focused on Songs with Messages that resonated with his Audience writing reflective Lyrics that draw Inspiration from the Birth of his Daughter."
