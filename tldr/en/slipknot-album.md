short_summary: "1999 studio album by Slipknot"
description: "Slipknot is the Debut Studio Album of the american heavy Metal Band Slipknot. It was released by Roadrunner Records on June 29 1999 following a Demo containing a few Songs that had previously been released in 1998. In December 1999 it was reissued with a slightly altered Track Listing and Mastering as the Result of a Lawsuit. It was the first Release of the Band produced by Ross Robinson who sought to refine Slipknot's Sound rather than alter the Group's musical Direction. This is the only Album featuring the original Guitarist Josh Brainard who left at the End of the Recording in late 1998 while the Band was taking a brief Break. Jim Root, who recorded two Tracks at this Point, would appear full Time on subsequent Albums starting with their next Album Iowa."
