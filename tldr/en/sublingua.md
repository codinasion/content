title: "Sublingua"
short_summary: "Secondary tongue found in some primates"
description: "The Sublingua is a muscular secondary Tongue found below the primary Tongue in Tarsiers and living Strepsirrhine Primates, which includes Lemurs and Lorisoids. Although it is most fully developed in these Primates, similar Structures can be found in some other Mammals, such as Marsupials, Treeshrews, and Colugos. This 'second Tongue' Lacks Taste Buds, and in Lemuriforms, it is thought to be used to remove Hair and other Debris from the Toothcomb, a specialized Dental Structure used to comb the Fur during oral Grooming."
