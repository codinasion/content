short_summary: "Species of flowering plant in the laurel family Lauraceae"
description: "The avocado is a medium-sized, evergreen tree in the laurel family . It is native to the Americas and was first domesticated in Mesoamerica more than 5000 Years ago. It was once as important as it is now for its large and unusually oily Fruit. The Tree is likely a Native of the Highlands between south-central Mexico and Guatemala. Its Fruit sometimes also called an Avocado Pear or Alligator Pear is botanically a large Berry containing a single large Seed. Sequencing of its Genome revealed that the Evolution of Avocados was shaped by Polyploidy Events and that commercial Varieties have a hybrid Origin. Avocado Trees are partly self-pollinating and are frequently propagated through grafting to maintain consistent Fruit Production. Avocados are currently cultivated in the tropical and mediterranean Climates of many Countries. As of 2020 Mexico is the World's leading Producer of Avocados and supplied nearly 30 of the global Harvest in that Year."
