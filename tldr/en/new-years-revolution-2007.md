description: "The 2007 new Year's Revolution was the third annual new Year's Revolution professional Wrestling pay-per-view Event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment. It was held exclusively for Wrestlers from the Promotion's raw Brand Division. It took Place on January 7, 2007, at Kemper Arena in Kansas City, Missouri. New Year's Revolution Ppv was discontinued after this 2007 Event due to the Reduction in the Number of Ppvs per Year following Wwe's Discontinuation of brand-exclusive Ppvs after wrestlemania 23 in April. In january 2020 Wwe revived the Event's Name for a Series of wwe Live Shows called the new Year's Revolution Tour and then revived it again for a special smackdown Episode in january 2024."
