title: "Plant defense against herbivory"
short_summary: "Plants' defenses against being eaten"
description: "Defense against Herbivory or host-plant Resistance is a Range of Adaptations evolved by Plants that improve their Survival and Reproduction by reducing the Impact of Herbivores on. Plants can sense being touched and can use several Strategies to protect against Damage caused by Herbivores. Many Plants produce secondary Metabolites known as Allelochemicals that influence the Behavior Growth or Survival of Herbivores. These chemical Defenses can act as Repellents or Toxins for Herbivores or reduce Plant Digestibility. Another defensive Strategy of Plants is changing their Attractiveness. To prevent Overconsumption by large Herbivores Plants alter their Appearance by changing their Size or Quality reducing the Rate at which they are consumed."
