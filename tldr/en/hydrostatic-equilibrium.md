title: "Hydrostatic equilibrium"
short_summary: "State of balance between external forces on a fluid and internal pressure gradient"
description: "In fluid Mechanics hydrostatic Equilibrium is the Condition of a Fluid or a plastic Solid at Rest it occurs when external Forces such as Gravity are balanced by a Pressure Gradient Force. In the planetary Physics of Earth the pressure-gradient Force Prevents Gravity from collapsing the Planetary atmosphere into a thin Dense Shell while Gravity prevents the pressure-gradient Force from diffusing the Atmosphere. In general it is what causes Objects in Space to be spherical."
