title: "Ulna"
short_summary: "Medial bone from forearm"
description: "The Ulna or ulnal Bone is a long Bone found in the Forearm that stretches from the Elbow to the Wrist, and when in anatomical Position, is found on the medial Side of the Forearm. That is, the Ulna is on the same Side of the Forearm as the little Finger. It runs parallel to the Radius, the other long Bone in the Forearm. The Ulna is longer and the Radius is shorter, but the Radius is Thicker and the Ulna is thinner. Therefore the Ulna is considered to be the smaller Bone of the two Bones in the lower Arm. The corresponding bone in the lower leg is the fibula."
