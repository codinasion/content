short_summary: "Input device for a video game controller"
description: "An Analog Stick also known as Control stick Joystick or Thumbstick is an Input Device for a Controller that is used for two-dimensional Input. An Analog Stick is a Variation of a joystick Consisting of a Protrusion from the Controller Input based on the Position of this Protrusion in Relation to the Default Center Position. While digital Sticks rely on single electrical Connections for Movement Analog Sticks use continuous electrical Activity running through Potentiometers to measure the precise Position of the Stick in its full Range of Motion. The Analog Stick has outgrown the D-Pad in both Prominence and Usage in video Games Consoles."
