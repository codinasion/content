short_summary: "History of the spread of Christianity"
description: "The Christianization of Poland Refers to the Introduction and subsequent Spread of Christianity in Poland. The Impetus to the Process was the Baptism of Poland, the personal Baptism of Mieszko i, the first Ruler of the future polish State, and much of his Court. The Ceremony took Place on Holy Saturday 14 april 966 although the exact Location is disputed by Historians with Pozna and Gniezno being the most likely Sites. Mieszko's Wife Dobrawa of Bohemia is often seen as a major Influence on Mieszko's Decision to accept Christianity."
