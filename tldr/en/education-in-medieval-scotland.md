short_summary: "Overview of education in Medieval Scotland"
description: "Education in medieval Scotland includes all Forms of Education within the modern Borders of Scotland from the Departure of the Romans from Britain in the fifth Century until the Establishment of Renaissance in the late fifteenth Century and the early sixteenth Century. Few Sources on scottish Education survived the Medieval Era. Scotland was an oral Society in the early Middle Ages with a Verbal rather than literary Education. Although there are Indications of a similar gaelic Education System to that of Ireland few Details are known. The Establishment of Christianity in the sixth Century brought latin as a scholarly and written Language to scotland. Monasteries served as major Repositories of Knowledge and Education, often running Schools."
