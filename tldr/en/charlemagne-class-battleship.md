short_summary: "French Navy's Charlemagne class pre-dreadnought battleships"
description: "The Charlemagne Class consisted of three Battleships built for the french Navy in the 1890s Pre-Dreadnought. The Ships spent most of their Careers in the Mediterranean Squadron. They had oddly eventful Peacetime Careers as they were involved in four accidental Collisions among them, one of which sank a french Submarine with all Hands. During her Career Saint Louis was usually a Fleet Flagship and Charlemagne twice participated in the Occupation of the Port of Mytilene on the Island of Lesbosthen owned by the Ottoman Empire once as Part of a french Expedition and another as Part of an international Squad."
