title: "Dagr"
short_summary: "Norse deity"
description: "Dagr is the divine Personification of the Day in norse Mythology. He appears in the poetic Edda compiled from earlier traditional Sources in the 13th Century and in the prose Edda written by snorri Sturluson in the 13Th. In both Sources, Dagr is stated to be the Son of the God Dellingr and is associated with the bright-maned Horse Skinfaxi, who 'draw Day to mankind'. Depending on Manuscript Variation, the Prose Edda adds that Dagr is either Dellingr's Son by Nótt, the personified Night, or Jörð, the personified Earth. Otherwise, Dagr appears as a common Noun simply meaning 'Day' throughout Old Norse works. Connections have been proposed between Dagr and other similarly named figures in Germanic mythology."
