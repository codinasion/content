short_summary: "Type of social hierarchy"
description: "In the zoological Field of Ethology a Dominance Hierarchy is a Type of social Hierarchy that arises when Members of animal social Groups interact creating a Ranking System. A dominant higher-ranking Individual is sometimes called an Alpha and a submissive lower-ranking Individual is called a Beta. Different Types of Interactions can result in Dominance depending on the Species, including ritualized Displays of Aggression or direct physical Violence. In social Living Groups Members may compete for Access to limited Resources and mating Opportunities. Rather than fighting each Time they meet, Individuals of the same Sex establish a relative Rank, with higher-ranking Individuals often gaining more Access to Resources and Mates. Based on repetitive Interactions a social Order is created that is subject to change every Time a dominant Animal is challenged by a Subordinate Animal."
