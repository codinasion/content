short_summary: "Religious decree in early modern Europe in 1568"
description: "The Edict of Torda was a Decree that authorized local Communities in the eastern hungary Kingdom of John Sigismund Zpolya to freely elect their Preachers. The Delegates of the Three Nations of Transylvania – the Hungarian Nobles, transylvanian Saxons, and Székelys – adopted it at the Request of the Monarch's antitrinitarian Court Preacher, Ferenc Dávid, in Torda on 28 January 1568. Although it did not recognize an Individual's Right to Freedom of Religion in sanctioning the Existence of a radical christian Religion in a european State the Decree was an unprecedented Act of religious Tolerance."
