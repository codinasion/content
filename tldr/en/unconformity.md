title: "Unconformity"
short_summary: "Rock surface indicating a gap in the geological record"
description: "An Unconformity is a buried erosional or non-depositional Surface separating two different Rock Masses or Strata of different Ages indicating that sediment Deposition was not continuous. The older Layer was generally exposed to Erosion for an Interval of Time before Deposition of the younger Layer but the Term is used to describe any Break in the sedimentary Geologic Record. The Significance of angular Unconformity was shown by James Hutton who found Examples of Hutton's Unconformity in Jedburgh in 1787 and in Siccar Point in Berwickshire in."
