short_summary: "Subfamily of birds"
description: "The River martins form a distinctive Subfamily Pseudochelidoninae within the Swallow and Martin Bird Family Hirundinidae. The two Species are the african River Martin Pseudochelidon Eurystomina found in the Congo and Gabon and the white-eyed River Martin pseudochelidon Sirintarae known only from one Site in. These are Medium sized largely black Swallows that have a light buoyant Flight and Feed on Insects that are caught in the Air. They appear to be more terrestrial than other Swallows, frequently walking rather than perching, and the white-eyed may be crepuscular. The african Species excavates nest Holes in sandy Ridges in Rivers while the Breeding Locations and Habits of asian Birds are unknown."
