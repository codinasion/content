title: "Late antiquity"
short_summary: "Post-classical antiquity in western Eurasia and northern Africa"
description: "Late Antiquity is sometimes defined as a Period spanning from the End of classical Antiquity to the local Start of the middle Ages from around the late 3rd Century up to the 7th or 8th Centuries in Europe and adjacent Areas bordering the Mediterranean Bas. The Popularisation of this Periodization in English has generally been credited to the historian Peter Brown who proposed a Period between 150 and 750 Ad. The Oxford Centre for late Antiquity defines the Period as between about 250 and 750. Precise boundary Zones are a continuing Matter of Debate. In the West, its End was earlier, with the Start of the early Middle Ages typically placed in the 6th Century, or even earlier on the Edges of the Western Roman Empire."
