description: "In Law, Receivership is a Situation in which an Institution or Enterprise is held by a receiver—a Person 'placed in the custodial Responsibility for the Property of Others, including tangible and intangible Assets and Rights' —especially in Cases where a Company can not meet its financial Obligations and is said to be insolvent. The Receivership Remedy is an equitable Remedy emerging from the english Chancery Courts where Receivers were appointed to protect real Property. Receiverships are also a last Resort Remedy in Litigation involving the Conduct of Executive Agencies that fail to comply with constitutional or statutory Obligations to Populations that rely on those Agencies for their basic human Rights."
