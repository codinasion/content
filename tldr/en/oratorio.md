short_summary: "Large musical composition including an orchestra, a choir, and soloists"
description: "An Oratorio is a large musical Composition for orchestra Choir and Soloists. Like most operas an Oratorio includes the Use of a Choir of Soloists an instrumental ensemble various distinguishable Characters and Arias. However, Opera is musical Theatre, while Oratorio is strictly a Concert Piece – though Oratorios are sometimes staged as Operas, and Operas are sometimes presented in concert Form. In an Oratorio the Choir often plays a central Role and there is generally little or no Interaction between Characters and there are no Props or elaborate Costumes. A particularly important Difference is the subject Matter of the Text. Opera tends to deal with History and Mythology, whereas the Plot of an Oratorio often deals with sacred Topics, making it appropriate for Performance in the Church. Catholic Composers looked to the Lives of Saints and bible Stories while protestant Composers focused on biblical Topics. In early 17th-century italy Oratorios became extremely popular partly because of the Success of the Opera and the catholic Church's Prohibition of Spectacles during Lent. Oratorios were the main Choice of Music in this Period for the Opera Audience."
