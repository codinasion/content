The Remixes had previously appeared on phantom Power's dvd Version but were released on Band's own Label Placid casual as a Way to ensure that the Remixers would receive Royalties for the Tracks. The Album features a Commentary from the fictional'Kurt Stern' who appears between Songs to discuss the Re-Recording of Phantom Power under his Guidance after being unhappy with the original. First Editions of the Album came packaged in a Case that doubled as a Paper Model of a Video Game arcade Cabinet, and included a Bonus Cd ; the Slow Life Ep.
