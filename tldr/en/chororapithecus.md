title: "Chororapithecus"
short_summary: "Extinct hominine genus from the Miocene"
description: "The Chororapithecus is an extinct great Ape from the afar Region of Ethiopia about 8 million Years ago during the late Miocene which comprises one Species c. abyssinicus. It is known from 9 isolated Teeth found in a Survey of the Chorora Formation in 2005-2007. The Teeth are indistinguishable in Terms of Absolute Size and relative Proportions from those of Gorillas and it has been proposed as an early Member of Gorillini. However this is controversial given the Paucity of Remains and noticeable anatomical Differences between Chororapithecus and Gorilla Teeth. The kenyan Ape Nakalipithecus has been suggested as an Ancestor of Chororapithecus or at least closely related. If correct, they would be the only identified fossil Members of any modern non-human great Ape Lineage, and would push the Gorillaâ€“Human last common Ancestor from 8 million Years ago to 10 million Years ago. The Teeth are adaptable for processing tough Plant Fibres as well as hard Brittle Food and the Formation is thought to represent a forested Lakeside Habitat."
