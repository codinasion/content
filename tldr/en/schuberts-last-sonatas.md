title: "Schubert's last sonatas"
short_summary: "Compositions by Franz Schubert"
description: "Franz Schubert's last three Sonatas for Piano D 958 959 and 960 are his last major Compositions for Solo Piano. They were written in the last Months of his Life between the Spring and Autumn of 1828 but were not published until about ten Years after his Death in 183839. In the 19th Century they were neglected mostly like the Rest of Schubert's Piano Sonatas. By the late 20th Century however public and critical Opinion had changed and these Sonatas are considered now among the most important of the Composer's Mature Masterpieces. They are Part of the Core Piano Repertoire appearing regularly on Concert Programs and Recordings."
