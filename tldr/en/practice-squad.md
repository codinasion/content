short_summary: "Group of players signed by a team but not part of their main roster"
description: "The Practice Squad also called Taxi Squad or Practice Roster in Sports is a Group of Players signed by a Team but not Part of their main Roster. They serve as extra Players during the Team's Practices often as Part of the Scout Team emulating an upcoming Opponent's Play Style. Because the Players on the Practice Squad are familiar with the Team's Plays and Formations the Practice Squad serves as a Way to develop inexperienced Players for Promotion to the main Roster. This is especially important for professional Gridiron Football Teams which do not have formal minor League Farm Team affiliates to train Players. The Company also provides Replacement Players for the main Roster when Players are needed as the Result of Injuries or other Roster Moves such as Bereavement leave."
