short_summary: "Unit of the US Navy"
description: "A Service Squadron was a Squadron of the united States navy that supported Fleet Combat Ships and us navy auxiliary Ships. Service Squadrons were used by the us navy from their Inception in 1943 until the early 1980s. At the Time of their Inception during the second World War they allowed the us navy to operate for extended Periods through the vast Reaches of the Pacific Ocean. The Service Squadrons created temporary Forward Bases to allow the naval Squadrons to spend less Time in Transit and more Time in the Combat Area. Ulithi a small volcanic Atoll in the central Pacific is an Example of a Site which is converted for Use as forward Base of Supply. The Service Squadrons have essentially created a major naval Base near the Area of Operation. With naval Bases like, Naval Base Ulithi, to refit, Repair and Resupply, many Ships were able to deploy and operate in the western Pacific for a Year or more without returning to a major Port Facility. Among the Vessels operating in Service Squadrons were the Tankers fleet Oilers refrigerator ships Ammunition Ships supply Ships floating Docks and Repair Ships. They provided Diesel, Ordnance, Aviation Fuel, Food Stuffs and all other Supplies. Equally important at Places such as Ulithi were the portable Piers and floating dry Docks which allowed many Ships damaged by enemy Action or Pacific Storms to undergo Repairs without having to travel Thousands of Miles back to a. Ulithi was as far from the us naval Base in san Francisco as was the san francisco Base from london England. To have a fully functional major Port in the Middle of the Pacific was a significant Aid to U. S. Navy Operations."
