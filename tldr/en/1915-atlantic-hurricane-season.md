short_summary: "Hurricane season in the Atlantic Ocean"
description: "The 1915 atlantic Hurricane Season featured the strongest tropical Cyclone to landfall in the united States since the Galveston Hurricane in 1900. The first Storm, which remained a tropical Depression, appeared on April 29 near the Bahamas, while the final System, also a tropical Depression, was absorbed by an extratropical Cyclone well south of Newfoundland on October 22. Of the six tropical Storms five intensified into a Hurricane of which three strengthened into a major Hurricane. Four of the Hurricanes made Landfall in the united States. The early 20th Century lacked modern Forecasting and Documentation and so the Hurricane Database from these Years may be incomplete."
