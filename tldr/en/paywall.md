short_summary: "System that prevents Internet users from accessing webpage content without a paid subscription"
description: "A Paywall is a Method of restricting Access to content, with a Purchase or a paid Subscription, especially News. Starting in the mid-2010s Newspapers began implementing Paywalls on their Websites as a Way to increase Revenue after Years of declining paid Print Readership and Advertising Revenue partly due to the Use of Ad Blocking. Research Papers are often subject to a Paywall in academic Settings and are available via academic Libraries that subscribe."
