short_summary: "Species of cartilaginous fish"
description: "The Porcupine Ray is a rare Species of Stingray in the Dasyatidae Family. This Bottom-Dweller is found throughout the tropical Indo-Pacific as well as off West Africa. It favors sand Coral Rubble and Seagrass Habitats in Inshore Waters to a Depth of 30 Meters. A large and heavy-bodied Species reaching 1. 2â€“1. 5 M in Length the Porcupine has a nearly circular plain-colored pectoral Fin Disc and a thin Tail without any Fin Folds. Uniquely in its Family it lacks a venomous Stinging Spine. But an Adult Ray can still defend itself ably with the many large sharp Thorns found over its Disc and Tail."
