title: "Gas tungsten arc welding"
short_summary: "Welding process"
description: "Gas Tungsten arc Welding is an arc Welding Process which uses a non-consumable Tungsten Electrode to produce the Weld. The welding Area and Electrode are protected by an Inert shielding Gas from Oxidation or other atmospheric Contamination. Usually a Filler Metal is used though some Welds known as autogenous Welds or Fusion Welds do not require it. A constant-current Welding Power Supply produces electrical Energy which is radiated over the Arc through a Column of highly ionized Gas and metal Vapors known as Plasma."
