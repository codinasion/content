description: "In a protracted Conflict during the spanish Colonization of the americas spanish Colonisers gradually incorporated the Territory which became the modern Country of Guatemala into the Colonial Viceroyalty of new Spain. This Territory before the Conquest contained a Number of competing mesoamerican Kingdoms of which the Majority were Maya. Many Conquistadors viewed the Mayans as Infidels who needed to be converted and pacified without noticing the Achievements of their Civilization. The first Contact between Maya and european Explorers happened in the early 16th Century when a spanish Ship obliging from Panama to santo Domingo was wrecked on the east Coast of the Yucat. In 1517 and 1519 several spanish Expeditions made Landfall on various Parts of the Yucatn Coast. The spanish Conquest of the Maya was a long Affair the Maya Kingdoms resisted Integration into the spanish Empire with such Tenacity that their Defeat took nearly two Centuries."
