This Territory before the Conquest contained a Number of competing mesoamerican Kingdoms of which the Majority were Maya. Many Conquistadors viewed the Mayans as Infidels who needed to be converted and pacified without noticing the Achievements of their Civilization. The first Contact between Maya and european Explorers happened in the early 16th Century when a spanish Ship obliging from Panama to santo Domingo was wrecked on the east Coast of the Yucat. In 1517 and 1519 several spanish Expeditions made Landfall on various Parts of the Yucatn Coast.
