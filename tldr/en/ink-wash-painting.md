short_summary: "Chinese painting style using black ink"
description: "Ink Wash Painting is a Type of chinese Ink Brush Painting that uses Washings of black Ink like that used in east asian Calligraphy in different Concentrations. It emerged during the Tang Dynasty of China and overturned earlier more realistic Techniques. It is typically monochrome using only black Shades with a great Emphasis on Virtuoso Brushwork and conveying the perceived Spirit or Essence of the Subject over direct Imitation. Paintings based on Inkwash were flourishing in China from the Song Dynasty as well as in Japan following its Introduction by zen Buddhist Monks in the 14Th. Some western Scholars divide chinese painting into three Periods: Times of Representation, Times of Expression, and historical Oriental Art. Chinese Scholars have their own Views which may be different ; they believe that contemporary chinese Ink Wash Paintings are the pluralistic Continuation of multiple historical Traditions."
