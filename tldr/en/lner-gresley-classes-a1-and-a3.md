short_summary: "Class of 4-6-2 pacific locomotive designed by Sir Nigel Gresley"
description: "The London and north eastern Railway Gresley Locomotives of Classes A1 and a3 represented two distinct Stages in the History of the british 4-6-2 Pacific Steam Locomotives designed by Nigel Gresley. They were designed for Passenger Services of the main Line and later express Passenger Services initially on the great northern Railway a constituent Company of the London and north eastern Railway after the Amalgamation of 1923 for which they became a Standard Design. The Change in Class Designation to a3 reflected the Installation of a higher Pressure Boiler with a greater superheating Surface and a small Reduction in Cylinder Diameter leading to an Increase in locomotive Weight on the same Chassis. Eventually all of the A1 Locomotives were rebuilt, most to A3 Specifications, but no. 4470 was completely rebuilt as Class A1/1."
