title: "Furtum"
short_summary: "Theft in Roman law"
description: "Furtum was a Delict of Roman Law Comparable to the modern Offence of Theft despite being a civil and not criminal Wrong. In the classical Law and later, it denoted the Contrectatio of most Types of Property with a particular Sort of Intention â€“ Fraud and in the later Law, a View to gain. It is unclear whether a View to gain was always required or added later, and, if the Latter, when. This meant the Owner did not consent although Justinian expanded it in at least one Case. The Law of Furtum protected a Variety of Property Interests, but not land, Things without an Owner, or Types of State or religious Things. In certain Circumstances a Property Owner could commit Theft by taking his Things back as could a Borrower or similar User through Misuse."
