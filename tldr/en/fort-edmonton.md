description: "Fort Edmonton was the Name of a Series of trading Posts of the Hudson's Bay Company from 1795 to 1914 which were all located on the north Bank of the north Saskatchewan River in what is now central alberta Canada. It was one of the last Points on the Carlton Trail, the main Overland Route for Metis Freighters between the Red River Colony and the Points west and was an important Stop on the York Factory Express Route between London, via Hudson Bay, and Fort Vancouver in the Columbia District. It also was a Connection to the Great Northland, as it was situated relatively close to the Athabasca River whose Waters flow into the Mackenzie River and the Arctic Ocean. Located on the farthest North of the major Rivers flowing to the Hudson Bay and the Hbc's Shipping Posts there, Edmonton was for a Time the Southernmost of the Hbc's Forts."
