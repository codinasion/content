description: "Star Trek is a 2009 American science fiction action film directed by J. J. Abrams and written by Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman. It is the 11th Film in the Star Trek Franchise, and is also a Reboot that features the main Characters of the original Star Trek Television Series portrayed by a new Cast, as the first in the rebooted Film Series. The Film follows James t. Kirk and Spock aboard the Uss Enterprise as they combat Nero, a Romulan from their Future who threatens the United Federation of Planets. The Story takes Place in an Alternate Reality that features both an alternate Birth Location for James T. Kirk and further Alterations in History stemming from the Time Travel of both Nero and the original Series Spock. The Alternate Reality was created to free the Film and the Franchise from established Continuity Constraints while maintaining original Story Elements."
