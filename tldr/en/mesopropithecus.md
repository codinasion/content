description: "Mesopropithecus is an extinct Genus of small to medium-sized Lemur or strepsirrhine Primate from Madagascar which includes three Species m. Dolichobrachion, M. Globiceps, and M. Pithecoides. Together with archaeoindris Palaeopropithecus and Babakotia it is Part of the Family of Sloth Lemurs. Once thought to be an indriid because its skull is similar to that of living sifakas, a recently discovered postcranial skeleton shows Mesopropithecus had longer forelimbs than hindlimbsâ€”a distinctive trait shared by sloth lemurs but not by indriids. However, as it had the shortest Forelimbs of all sloth Lemurs, it is thought that Mesopropithecus was more quadrupedal and did not use Suspension as much as the other Sloth Lemurs."
