description: "Marriage is an experimental Art Game created by Rod humble and released in March 2007 for microsoft Windows. Humble set out to explore the Forms of artistic Expression Unique to video Games, leading him to express his Feelings associated with Marriage by relying primarily on Game Mechanics rather than on traditional Storytelling, Audio, or video Elements. The Game uses only simple colored Shapes which the Player interacts with with a Mouse. The Player's Actions cause Pink and blue Squares to increase or decrease in both Size and Opacity, representing the Balance of personal Needs in a Relationship."
