While stationed near Paris he was recorded as having eaten 174 Cats in a Year and although he disliked Vegetables he would eat 4 to 5 Pounds of Grass a Day if he could n't find other. During Service on the french Ship Hoche he tried to eat a Member of the Crew hit by Cannon Fire before other Members of the Crew came to him."
