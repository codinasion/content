description: "Charles Domery, later also known as Charles Domerz, was a polish Soldier serving in the prussian and french Armies, noted for his unusually large Appetite. Serving in the prussian Army against France during the first Coalition War he found that the Rations of the Prussians were insufficient and deserted the french Army in Exchange for Food. Although generally healthy he was voraciously hungry while he served in the french Service and ate any available Food. While stationed near Paris he was recorded as having eaten 174 Cats in a Year and although he disliked Vegetables he would eat 4 to 5 Pounds of Grass a Day if he could n't find other. During Service on the french Ship Hoche he tried to eat a Member of the Crew hit by Cannon Fire before other Members of the Crew came to him."
