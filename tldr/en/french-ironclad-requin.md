short_summary: "Ironclad warship of the French Navy"
description: "Requin was an ironclad Barbette Ship built in the late 1870S and early 1880s for the french Navy. She was the last Member of four Ships of the terrible Class. They were built as Part of a Fleet Plan started in 1872 which had been aimed against the strengthening italian Fleet by the late 1870S. The Ships were intended for coastal Operations and as such had a shallow Draft and a low Freeboard which severely hindered their Seakeeping and thus reduced their Ability to be usefully employed outside of coastal Operations after entering Service. Armament consisted of a Pair of 420 Mm Guns in individual Barbettes the largest-caliber Gun ever mounted on a french Capital Ship. Requin was laid down in 1878 and finished in 1887."
