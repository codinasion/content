description: "Hurricane Cristobal was a moderately strong atlantic tropical Cyclone that affected multiple Landmasses from Puerto Rico to iceland in late August and early September 2014. Slow to develop and inhibited by unfavorable Wind Shear for most of its Duration the Storm formed from a long-tracked tropical Wave near the Caicos islands on August23. Moving generally northward cristobal slowly intensified despite a ragged Appearance on satellite Imagery and passed on August 27 between Bermuda and north Carolina. The following Day cristobal reached its peak Strength on a rapidly moving northeastern Hurricane while expanding Northeast.
