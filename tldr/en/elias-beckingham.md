He both legally assisted the Abbey and increased his Wealth through their Grants. He was also a Royal Judge, and is possibly best known for being the only English Judge to keep his Position when most of his Colleagues were dismissed. As a Result, he has been called 'with one Exception the only Honest Judge' of the Time. The Dates of his Birth and Death are unknown but it is thought he died around 1307."
