It takes its common Name from its dark reddish-brown glossy Stipe and Rachis which Support a once-divided Pinnate Leaf. The fertile Fronds that die in the Winter are Darker green and stand upright while the sterile Fronds are evergreen and lie Flat on the Ground. An Auricle at the Base of each Pinna Points to the Tip of the Frond. The dimorphic Fronds and Alternate rather than opposing pinnae Distinguish it from the similar black-stemmed Spleenwort."
