description: "Wie Schön Leuchtet Der Morgenstern, Bwv 1, is a Church Cantata for Annunciation by Johann Sebastian Bach. When the Cantata was composed in 1725 the Feast of the Annunciation was celebrated on Palm Sunday. Based on Philipp Nicolai's Hymn Wie Schn Leuchtet Der Morgenstern is one of Bach's Chorale Cantatas. Bach composed it as Thomaskantor in leipzig his second Year where the marian Feast was the only Occasion during Lent when Music of this Type was allowed. The Hymn's Theme Suits both the Annunciation and Palm sunday Occasions in a Spirit of a Longing for an Arrival. As usual for Bach's chorale Cantata Cycle the Hymn was paraphrased by a contemporary Poet who retained the Hymn's first and last Stanzas unchanged but transformed the Themes of the inner Stanzas into a Sequence of alternating."
