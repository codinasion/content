description: "The Avarbyzantine Wars were a Series of Conflict between the Byzantine Empire and the Avar Khaganate. The Conflicts were initiated in 568 when the Avars arrived in Pannonia and claimed to themselves the whole former Land of the Gepids and Lombards. This led to an unsuccessful Attempt to seize Sirmium from Byzantium which had previously taken it from the Gepids. Most subsequent Conflicts were the Result of Raids by the Avars or their Subjects slavs into the balkan Provinces of the Byzantine Empire."
