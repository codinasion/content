short_summary: "North-south highway in U.S. state of Georgia"
description: "Georgia State Route 400 is a Freeway and State Highway in the U. S. State of Georgia serving Parts of Metro Atlanta. It is concurrent with U. S. Route 19 from Exit 4 until its northern terminus South-Southeast of Dahlonega, linking the City of Atlanta to its north-central Suburbs and Exurbs. Sr400 Travels from lindbergh Neighborhood in the buckhead District of Atlanta on Interstate85 to just South-Southeast of Dahlonega. Like the Interstate Highways, it is a limited-access Road, but unlike the Interstates, the Exit Numbers are not mileage-based, they are sequential. Once the Sr400 passes the Exit 18 it transforms from a limited-access Freeway into an at-grade divided Highway with Traffic Lights but still with a high Speed Limit of 65 Miles per Hour and ends at J. B. Jones Intersection at Sr 60/sr 115 in Lumpkin County."
