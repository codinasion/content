short_summary: "Chemical reaction in organic chemistry"
description: "The saegusaito Oxidation is a chemical Reaction used in organic Chemistry. It was discovered by takeo Saegusa and Yoshihiko Ito in 1978 as a Method to introduce Unsaturation in Carbonyl Compounds. The Reaction as originally reported involved the Formation of a silyl Enol Ether followed by Treatment with Palladium Acetate and Benzoquinone to yield the corresponding Enone. The original Publication noted its Utility for Regeneration of Unsaturation following 1,4-addition with Nucleophiles such as Organocuprates."
