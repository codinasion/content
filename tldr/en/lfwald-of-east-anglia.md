short_summary: "8th-century king of East Anglia"
description: "Lfwald was an 8th Century King of east Anglia an anglo-saxon Kingdom that includes the english Counties of Norfolk and Suffolk. The last King of the Wuffingas Dynasty, Ælfwald succeeded his Father Ealdwulf, who had ruled for 49 Years. Ælfwald himself ruled for 36 Years. Their combined Reigns, with barely any Record of external military Action or internal dynastic Strife, represent a long Period of peaceful Stability for the East Angles. In Lfwald's Time this was probably due to a Number of Factors including the settled Nature of east anglian ecclesiastical Affairs and the Prosperity brought through Rhineland Commerce with the East. The Coinage of Anglo-Saxon Sceattas expanded in Ælfwald's Time: Evidence of East anglian Mints, Markets, and Industry are suggested where Concentrations of such Coins have been discovered."
