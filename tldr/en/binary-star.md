short_summary: "System of two stars orbiting each other"
description: "A binary Star System or binary Star System is a System of two Stars gravitationally bound to and orbit each other. Binary Stars in the Night Sky that are seen to the naked Eye as a single Object are often resolved using a Telescope as separate Stars which in this Case are called visual Binaries. Many visual Binaries have long orbital Periods of several Centuries or Millennia and therefore have Orbits which are unknown or poorly known. They can be also detected using indirect Techniques such as Spectroscopy or Astrometry. If a binary Star Orbits along our Line of Sight its Components will eclipse and transit each other these Pairs are called eclipsing Binaries or together with other Binaries that Change Brightness as they orbit photometric Binaries."
