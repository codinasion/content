short_summary: "Species of bird"
description: "The golden swallow is a swallow endemic to the Caribbean island of Hispaniola and was once native to Jamaica, but is now extirpated there. It is restricted to isolated montane forests that primarily consist of the Hispaniolan pine. This species is considered a vulnerable Species by the international Union for Conservation of Nature. The exact Cause of its Extinction from Jamaica is unknown but likely Factors include Predation by introduced Mammals and habitat Loss although the habitat Loss Theory is not supported by much Evidence. The last Sighting of the nominate Subspecies occurred in Hardwar Gap on June 8 1989 with three Birds being seen."
