short_summary: "Energy change of a nucleus after radioactive decay"
description: "The Decay Energy is the Energy Change of a Nucleus which underwent a radioactive Decay. Radioactive Decay is the Process of the atomic Nucleus losing Energy by emitting ionizing Particles and Radiation. This Decay or Loss of Energy Results in an Atom of a specific Type becoming an Atom of a different Type."
