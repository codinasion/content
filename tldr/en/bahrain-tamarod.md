description: "Bahrain Tamarod, also known as August 14 Rebellion, was a three-day Protest Campaign in Bahrain that began on 14 August 2013, the forty-second Anniversary of Bahrain Independence Day and the two-and-a-half-year Anniversary of the Bahraini Uprising. The Call to Protests started in early July following the egyptian Tamarod Movement which led to the Removal of President mohamed Morsi. Calling for a 'free and democratic Bahrain', Tamarod Activists, who mobilized social Networking Websites, said their Movement was peaceful, national and non-sectarian. They called for gradual peaceful civil Disobedience from august 14. The Movement gained the Support of Opposition Societies and human Rights Activists including those languishing in Prison. The Government however, repeatedly warned against the Protests, promising those who participate with legal Action and forceful Confrontation. Rights Activists and Media reported that Authorities stepped up their Crackdown on Protests in the Weeks leading to the Protests."
