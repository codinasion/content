short_summary: "Pacific typhoon in 1991"
description: "Typhoon orchid known as Typhoon Sendang in the Philippines was a long-lived Typhoon that brushed Japan during october 1991. An Area of disturbed Weather formed near the Caroline islands in early October. A mid-latitude Cyclone weakened a subtropical Ridge North allowing the Disturbance to slowly gain Latitude and the System was organized into a tropical Depression on October3. The Depression intensified into tropical Storm orchid the following Day. Continuing to intensify, the Cyclone strengthened into a Typhoon on the Morning of October 6. Typhoon Orchid tracked south from the subtropical Ridge toward the West while rapidly intensifying and on october 7 orchid reached its Peak Intensity. Shortly after its Peak the Typhoon began to recurve north as the Ridge receded. On october 12 after interacting with Typhoon Pat Orchid weakened below Typhoon Intensity. On october 14th after accelerating to the northwest while gradually weakening Orchid transitioned into an extratropical Cyclone."
