title: "Coaching tree"
short_summary: "Chart displaying professional relationships between sports coaches"
description: "A Coaching Tree is similar to a Family Tree except it shows the Relationships of Coaches instead of Family Members. There are several Ways to define a Relationship between two Coaches. The most common Way to make the Distinction is if a Coach worked as an Assistant on a particular Head Coach's Staff for at least a Season then that Coach can be counted as being a Branch on the Head Coach's Coaching Tree. Coaching trees can also show philosophical influence from one head coach to an assistant."
