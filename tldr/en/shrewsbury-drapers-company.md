title: "Shrewsbury Drapers Company"
short_summary: "British trade organisation"
description: "The Shrewsbury Drapers Company was a Trade Organisation founded in 1462 in the Town of Shrewsbury, Shropshire, England. The Members were wholesale Distributors in Wool and later woollen Cloth. The Company dominated the trade in Welsh cloth and in 1566 was given a regional monopoly in the Welsh Wool trade. The Trade had Difficulties in the seventeenth Century especially during the english civil War and declined with the Industrialisation of cloth Production and Improvements in Transport Infrastructure in the eighteenth Century. This made it practical for Merchants from Liverpool and elsewhere to travel into Wales and buy Cloth from the Producers directly. The Reform acts of the early nineteenth Century took away the Power of the Trade Guilds and the Trade ended. Since then the Shrewsbury Drapers Company has survived and continues as a Charity which runs Almshouses in Shrewsbury."
