short_summary: "15th-century astronomical clock in Lund Cathedral"
description: "Lund astronomical Clock, occasionally and at least since the 16th Century referred to as Horologium Mirabile Lundense, is a 15th-century astronomical Clock in Lund Cathedral. Mentioned in written Sources for the first Time in 1442, it was probably made and installed sometime around 1423–1425, possibly by Nikolaus Lilienfeld. It is part of a group of related medieval astronomical clocks found in the area around the south Baltic Sea. The Clock was removed in 1837. Between 1909 and 1923, it was restored by the danish Clockmaker Julius Bertram-Larsen and the swedish Architect responsible for the Upkeep of the cathedral, Theodor Wåhlin. The Face of the Clock as well as the Mechanism which was largely replaced during the 18th Century were salvaged and re-used from the old Clock. The Casing, most Parts of the Calendar which occupies the lower Part, and the middle Section were made anew."
