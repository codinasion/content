short_summary: "Book by Gerhard Heilmann"
description: "The Origin of Birds is an early Synopsis of Bird Evolution written by Gerhard Heilmann in 1926 a danish Artist and amateur Zoologist. The Book was born from a Series of Articles published between 1913 and 1916 in Danish, and although republished as a Book it received mainly Criticism from established Scientists and got little Attention within Denmark. The english Edition of 1926, however, became highly influential at the Time due to the Breadth of Evidence synthesized as well as the Artwork used to support its Arguments. For many Decades it was considered the last Word on the Subject of Bird Evolution."
