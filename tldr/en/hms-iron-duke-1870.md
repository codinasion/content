description: "Hms Iron Duke was the last of four audacious-class central Battery Ironclads built for the Royal Navy in the late 1860S. The Ship was completed in 1871 and was Briefly assigned to the Reserve Fleet as a Guard Ship in Ireland before she was sent as its Flagship to the China Station. Iron Duke returned four Years later and resumed her Duties as guardian. She accidentally rammed and sank her sister ship Vanguard in a heavy Fog in Mid-1875 and returned in 1878 to the far east. The Ship ran aground twice during this Deployment and returned Home in 1883. Iron Duke was assigned to the Channel Fleet in 1885 after a lengthy Refit and remained there until she was again appointed Guard Ship in 1890. The Ship was converted into a Coal Hulk a Decade later and continued in this Role until 1906 when she was sold and broke up for Scrap."
