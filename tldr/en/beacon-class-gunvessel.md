short_summary: "British class of composite gunboats"
description: "The Beacon-Class Gunboats were a Class of composite Gunboats built in the late 1860S for the Royal Navy. They were the first Warships of the Royal navy expressly designed to use Engines of an older Class of Ships with a different Hull Shape. They were generally deployed overseas to the China, East Indies, West Africa, Pacific, North America and West Indies Stations. In Addition to showing their Flag the Ships fought Pirates and suppressed the slave Trade in east and west Africa. As their Engines wore out in the Mid-1880S they were mostly retired and scrapped by the End of the Decade. Some survived through the early 1900s as they were modified for harbour Service before being sold or scrapped."
