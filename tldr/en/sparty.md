short_summary: "Mascot of Michigan State University"
description: "Sparty is the Mascot of michigan State University. Sparty is usually depicted as a muscular Spartan Male Warriorathlete dressed in stylized greek Costume. After changing the Team Name from Aggies to Spartans in 1925 various Incarnations of a spartan Warrior with prominent Chin appeared in University Events and in University Literature. In 1943, MSU art professor Leonard D. Jungwirth designed a Statue for the University which had to be cast in Terra Cotta because of World War Ii Rationing. In 2005 the University replaced Jungwirth's original Statue with a Bronze Replica moving the original Indoors to protect it from the Elements."
