title: "Intramuscular injection"
short_summary: "Medical injection into a muscle"
description: "Intramuscular Injection often abbreviated Im is the Injection of a Substance into the Muscle. In Medicine it is one of several Methods of parenteral Drug Administration. Intramuscular Injection may be preferred because Muscles have larger and more numerous Blood Vessels than subcutaneous Tissue resulting in Quicker Absorption than subcutaneous or intradermal Injections. Medication administered via intramuscular Injection is not subject to the first-pass Metabolism Effect that affects oral Medications."
