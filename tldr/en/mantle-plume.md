title: "Mantle plume"
short_summary: "Upwelling of abnormally hot rock within Earth's mantle"
description: "A mantle Plume is a proposed Mechanism of Convection in the Earth's mantle hypothesized to explain anomalous Volcanism. Because the plume Head partially melts on reaching shallow Depths a Plume is often invoked as the Cause of volcanic Hotspots such as Hawaii or Iceland and large igneous Provinces such as the deccan and the siberian Traps. Some such volcanic Areas lie far from the tectonic Plate Boundaries while Others represent unusually large Volume Volcanism near Plate Boundaries."
