short_summary: "1066–1216 period in English history"
description: "In the History of England the high Middle Ages spanned the Period from the norman Conquest in 1066 to the Death of king John considered by some Historians in 1216 to be the last Angevin King. A disputed Succession and Victory at the Battle of Hastings led to the Conquest of England by William of Normandy in 1066. This linked the Kingdom of England with Norman Possessions in the Kingdom of France and brought a new Aristocracy to the Country that dominated Landholding, Government and the Church. They brought the french Language with them and maintained their Rule through a System of Castles and the Introduction of a feudal System of landholding. By William's Death in 1087 England formed the largest Part of an anglo-norman Empire ruled by Nobles with Landholdings throughout England Normandy and Wales. William's Sons disputed Succession of his Lands with william Ii emerging as Ruler of England and most of Normandy. On his Death in 1100 his Younger Brother claimed the Throne as Henry I and defeated his Brother Robert to reunite England and normandy. Henry was a Ruthless yet effective King but after the Death of his only Male Heir William adelin he persuaded his Barons to recognise his Daughter Matilda as his. When Henry died in 1135 her Cousin Stephen of Blois proclaimed himself king leading to a civil War known as the Anarchy. Eventually Stephen recognised Matilda's son Henry as his heir and when Stephen died in 1154, he succeeded as Henry II."
