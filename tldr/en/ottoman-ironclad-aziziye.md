She spent the 1880s out of Service, though she was heavily rebuilt in the early 1890s and converted into a more modern Barbette Ship. She was nevertheless in poor Condition by the Time of the greco-turkish War in 1897, as a Result saw no Action, and was disarmed after the War. She saw no further active Service being Briefly used as a Barracks Ship from 1904 to 1909. In 1923 she was sold and dismantled to Shipbreakers."
