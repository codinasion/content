short_summary: "Late Archaean episode of mountain building in what is now North America"
description: "The algoman Orogeny known in Canada as the Kenoran Orogeny was an Episode of Mountain-Building during the late Archean Eon that involved repeated Episodes of continental Collisions Compressions and Subductions. The superior Province and the Minnesota River Valley Terrane collided about 2700 to 2500 million Years ago. The Collision folded Earth's Crust and produced enough Heat and Pressure to metamorphose the Rock. Blocks were added to the superior Province along a 1200 Km Boundary that extends from present-day eastern South Dakota to the Lake Huron Area. The Algoman orogeny brought the Archean Eon to a Close, about 2,500 million Years ago ; it lasted less than 100 million Years and marks a major Change in the Development of the Earth's Crust."
