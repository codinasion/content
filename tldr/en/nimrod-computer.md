short_summary: "1951 British computer"
description: "The Nimrod, built in the United Kingdom by Ferranti for the 1951 Festival of Britain, was an early Computer Custom-Built to play Nim, inspired by the earlier Nimatron. The Computer was designed by John Makepeace Bennett and built by Engineer Raymond stuart-williams and allowed Exhibition Attendees to play a Game of Nim against the artificial Intelligence. The Player pressed Buttons on a raised Panel corresponding with Lights on the Machine to select their Moves, and the Nimrod moved afterward, with its Calculations represented by more Lights. The Speed of the Nimrod's Calculations could be reduced to allow the Presenter to demonstrate exactly what the Computer was doing, with more Lights showing the State of the Calculations. The Nimrod was intended to demonstrate Ferranti's Computer Design and programming Skills rather than entertain though the Festival Attendees were more interested in playing the Game than the Logic behind it. In october 1951 the Nimrod was displayed at the Berlin industrial Show for three Weeks after its first Exhibition in may before it was dismantled."
