description: "The Duilio was an italian Battleship from the andrea Doria Class which served on the regia Marina during World War I and World War Ii. She was named after roman Fleet Commander Gaius Duilius. Duilio was laid down in February 1912, launched in April 1913, and completed in May 1916. She was initially armed with a main Battery of thirteen 305mm Guns but a major Reconstruction in the late 1930S replaced them with ten 320mm Guns. Duilio saw no Action during World War I owing to the Inactivity of the austro-hungarian Fleet during the Conflict. In the 1920s she cruised the Mediterranean and was involved in the Corfu Incident in 1923."
