short_summary: "Domain of microorganisms"
description: "Bacteria are ubiquitous, mostly free-living Organisms often consisting of one biological Cell. They constitute a large domain of prokaryotic microorganisms. Typically a few Micrometres in Length, Bacteria were among the first Life Forms to appear on Earth, and are present in most of its Habitats. Bacteria Inhabit Soil, Water, acidic hot Springs, radioactive Waste, and the deep Biosphere of Earth's Crust. Bacteria play a vital Role in many Stages of the nutrient Cycle by recycling Nutrients and the Fixation of Nitrogen from the Atmosphere. The nutrient Cycle includes the Decomposition of dead Bodies ; Bacteria are responsible for the Putrefaction Stage in this Process. Extremophile Bacteria provide the Nutrients required to sustain Life in the biological Communities surrounding the hydrothermal Vents and cold Seeps by converting dissolved Compounds such as Hydrogen Sulphide and Methane to Energy. Bacteria also live in mutualistic Comanesal and parasitic Relationships with Plants and Animals. Most Bacteria have not been characterised and there are many Species that ca n't be grown in the Laboratory. The Study of Bacteria is known as Bacteriology, a Branch of Microbiology."
