short_summary: "Aspect of history"
description: "Aspirin is a novel Organic Compound which does not occur in Nature and was first successfully synthesized in 1899. In 1897 Scientists at Bayer's Drug and dye Company began investigating acetylated organic Compounds as new Medicines after the Success of acetanilide ten Years earlier. By 1899 Bayer created acetylsalicylic Acid and named the Drug'Aspirin' which was eventually sold all over the World. The Word Aspirin was Bayer's Brand Name rather than the generic Name of the Drug however Bayer's Rights to the Trademark were lost or sold in many Countries. Over the first Half of the twentieth Century Aspirin's Popularity grew leading to fierce Competition with the Proliferation of aspirin Brands and Products."
