short_summary: "12th-century Roman Catholic Church council at France starting in 1148"
description: "In 1148 a Council of Reims was called by Pope Eugene Iii to consider a Range of Issues for the Church. Originally the Summons to the Council went out in October 1147 and it was supposed to be held in February 1148 at Trier, but Conditions there were such that it was moved to Reims. A Number of the Bishops and other Churchmen who had been convoked did not attend and eugene suspended many of the non-attendees except the other Churchmen of Italy who were excused. The Council convened on 21 March 1148 and is said to have lasted 11 Days in total, which would give an End Date of 1 April 1148. It is however possible that it was shorter given that the large Population of Reims would have strained the Town's Resources."
