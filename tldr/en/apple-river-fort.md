description: "Apple River Fort, Today known as the Apple River Fort State Historic Site, was one of many frontier Forts hastily completed by Settlers in northern Illinois and southern Wisconsin following the Onset of the 1832 Black Hawk War. The Fort was built at the Settlement of Apple River in less than a Week and was situated in present-day Elizabeth Illinois. It was one of the few Forts that were attacked during the War and the only one attacked by a Band led by black Hawk himself. At the Battle of Apple River fort a Firefight of about an Hour ensued with black Hawk's Forces eventually withdrawing from the Battlefield. The Fort had one Militiaman killed in Action and another wounded. After the War the Fort stood until 1847 being occupied by Squatters before being sold to a private Property Owner who dismantled the Building."
