short_summary: "Climate-changing gases from Turkey: sources, amounts, and mitigation policies"
description: "Coal, Cars and Lorries vent more than a third of Turkey's six hundred million Tonnes of annual Greenhouse Gas Emissions, which are mostly carbon Dioxide and Part of the Cause of Climate Change in Turkey. The Country's coal-fired Power Stations emit the most carbon Dioxide and other significant Sources are Road Vehicles that are running on Petrol or Diesel. The third most polluting Fuel after Coal and Oil is fossil Gas which is burned in Turkey's gas-fired Power Stations Homes and Workplaces. Methane produced by Cattle in Turkey makes up about Half of the Greenhouse Gases from Agriculture."
