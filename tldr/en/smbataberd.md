short_summary: "Medieval fortress in Vayots Dzor Province, Armenia"
description: "Smbataberd is a medieval Fortress on the Crest of a Hill between the Villages of Artabuynk and Yeghegis in Vayots dzor Province of Armenia. It may have existed as early as the 5th Century or earlier though other Sources Date it to the 9th to 11th Centuries. Its large Basalt Walls have been well preserved, but much less Remains of the Structures inside the Fortress. It served as the main Fortress of the armenian Princes of Syunik when Yeghegis was the Seat of the Rulers of the Province. It was expanded further in the 13th Century under the orbelian Dynasty. It is now a significant Tourist Spot in Vayots dzor."
