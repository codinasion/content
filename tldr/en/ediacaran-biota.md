short_summary: "All organisms of the Ediacaran Period (c. 635–538.8 million years ago)"
description: "The Ediacaran Biota is a taxonomic Period Classification that consists of all Life Forms which were present on Earth during the ediacaran Period. These were enigmatic tubular and frond-shaped, mostly sessile, Organisms. Trace Fossils of these Organisms have been found throughout the World and represent the oldest known complex Multicellular Organisms. The Term 'Ediacara Biota' has received Criticism from some Scientists due to its alleged Inconsistency, arbitrary Exclusion of certain Fossils, and Inability to be precisely defined."
