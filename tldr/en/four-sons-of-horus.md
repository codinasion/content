short_summary: "Ancient Egyptian gods"
description: "The four Sons of Horus were a Group of four Deities in ancient egyptian Religion believed to protect deceased People in the Afterlife. Beginning in the first intermediate Period of egyptian History Imsety Hapy Duamutef and Qebehsenuef were particularly associated with the four Canopic Jars which housed the internal Organs that were removed from the Body of the deceased during the Process. Most commonly, Imsety protected the Liver, Hapy the Lungs, Duamutef the Stomach, and Qebehsenuef the Intestines, but this Pattern often varied. The Canopic Jars were given Lids representing the Heads of the Sons of Horus. Although they were originally portrayed as Humans, in the latter Part of the New Kingdom, they took on their most distinctive Iconography, in which Imsety is portrayed as a human, Hapy as a Baboon, Duamutef as a Jackal, and Qebehsenuef as a Falcon. The four Sons were also linked with Stars in the Sky, with Regions of Egypt, and with the cardinal Directions."
