short_summary: "List of highways in Michigan"
description: "There are currently four Business Routes on interstate 69 in the us State of Michigan. Designated Business Loop Interstate 69, they are all former routings of I-69's predecessor highways, US Highway 27 , M-78 or M-21, in whole or in part. The Bl I-69 in Coldwater and the one in Charlotte were both Parts of Us 27 before the Freeway bypassed those two Cities in 1967 and the early 1970s, respectively. The Bl I-69 through Lansing and East Lansing was previously Part of M-78 and Temporary I-69 until it was redesignated in 1987. The Loop in Port Huron was originally Part of M-21 before 1984 and was initially a Business Spur numbered Business Spur Interstate69. It was later redesignated when it was extended to run concurrently with that City's Bl I-94 which was originally Part of I-94's Predecessor, Us 25. Each Business Loop follows Streets through each City's downtown Areas and Connects to I-69 on both Ends, giving Traffic a Route through the Downtown and back to the Freeway."
