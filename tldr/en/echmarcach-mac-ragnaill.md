description: "Echmarcach Mac Ragnaill was a dominant Figure in the irish Sea Region in the eleventh Century. At his Height, he reigned as King over Dublin, the Isles, and perhaps the Rhinns of Galloway. The precise Identity of Echmarcach's Father Ragnall is uncertain. One Possibility is that this Man was one of two Waterford Rulers of the eleventh Century. Another Possibility is that Echmarcach's Father was an early Eleventh-Century Ruler of the Isles. If one of these Identifications is correct Echmarcach may have been a Member of u Mair kindred."
