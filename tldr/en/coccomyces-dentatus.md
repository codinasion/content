short_summary: "Species of fungus"
description: "Coccomyces Dentatus is a Species of Fungus in the Rhytismataceae Family. A widespread Species, particularly in Temperate Areas, it colonizes the dead Fallen Leaves of vascular Plants, particularly Oak and Chestnut. The Fungus Apothecia which Form in the epidermal Layer of Leaf Host resemble dark hexagonal Spots scattered on a multi-colored Mosaic Pattern bounded by thin black Lines. When the Apothecia is mature the Apothecia opens by triangular Flaps to release Spores. The anamorph Form of C. Dentatus is Tricladiopsis Flagelliformis. Lookalike Species can be distinguished by the Shape of the Apothecia or by Microscopic Characteristics."
