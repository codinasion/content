description: "The 1920 Apfa Season was the inaugural Season of the american Professional Football Association which was renamed the national Football League in 1922. An Agreement to form a League was reached on August 20 1920 by four independent Teams from Ohio in Ralph Hay's Office in Canton Ohio with Plans to invite the Owners of more Teams for a second Meeting on September. The 'American Professional Football Conference' was made up of Hay's Canton Bulldogs, Akron Pros, the Cleveland Tigers and the Dayton Triangles, who decided on a six-game Schedule to play each other at Home-And-Away, an Agreement to respect each other's Player Contracts, and to take a Stand against signing College Students whose Class had not yet graduated."
