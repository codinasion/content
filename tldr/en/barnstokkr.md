short_summary: "Mythological tree"
description: "Barnstokkr is a Tree which stands at the Center of king Vlsung's Hall in norse Mythology. Barnstokkr is attested in chapters 2 and 3 of the Völsunga saga, written in the 13th century from earlier tradition, partially based on events from the 5th century and the 6th century, where, during a banquet, a one-eyed, very tall man appears and thrusts a sword into the tree which only Sigmund is able to pull free. Scholarly Theories have been given about the Implications of Barnstokkr and its Relation to other Trees in germanic Pagan Paganism."
