short_summary: "Genre of film which emphasizes humour"
description: "A Comedy Film is a Category of Film that emphasizes Humor. These films are designed to amuse audiences and make them laugh. Films in this Genre have typically a happy ending with dark Comedy being an Exception. Comedy is one of the oldest Genres in Film, and it is derived from classical Comedy in Theatre. Some of the earliest silent Films were comedy such as Slapstick Comedy which often relies on visual Representations such as Sight Gags and Pratfalls so that they can be enjoyed without Sound. To provide Drama and Excitement to silent Films live Music was played in Sync with the Action on the Screen on Pianos Organs and other Instruments. When sound Films became more Prevalent in the 1920s Comedy Films grew in Popularity as Laughter could result from both burlesque Situations but also humorous Dialogue."
