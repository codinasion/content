description: "The atlantic Hurricane Season of 1865 included two land-falling Hurricanes with one that caused over 325 Deaths. The first Storm was reported by Ships in the western Caribbean on may 30. A Month later a Storm Hit southern Texas and a Storm paralleled the Coast of the Carolinas in late August. The fourth Storm of the Season was also the longest forming East of the lesser Antilles before hitting Guadeloupe and eventually moving ashore in Louisiana. In both of its major Landfalls the Storm destroyed many Homes. There was Confusion as to whether the fifth Storm of the Season was separate from the fourth as both Systems struck louisiana in September. Another Hurricane struck in late September before the End of the Season developed North of Panama. The final Hurricane struck Cuba and key west Florida before dissipating on october 25 North of Bermuda."
