title: "Chaos Crags"
short_summary: "Mountain in the Cascade range in California"
description: "Chaos Crags is the youngest Group of Lava Domes in the Lassen volcanic national Park California. They formed as six dacite Domes 1,100-1,000 Years ago, one Dome collapsing during an explosive Eruption about 70 Years later. The Eruptions at Chaos Crags mark one of three Instances of Holocene Activity within the volcanic Center of Lassen. The Cluster of Domes is located North of lassen Peak and form the Southernmost Segment of the Cascade Range in northern California. Each Year a Lake is formed at the Base of the Crags and typically Dries at the End of the Summer Season."
