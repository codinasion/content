short_summary: "Ancient Greek ethnic group"
description: "The Macedonians were an ancient Tribe that lived on the alluvial Plain around the Rivers haliacmon and lower Axios in the northeastern Part of Mainland Greece. They essentially were ancient greek People extending slowly from their Homeland along the haliacmon Valley on the northern Edge of the greek World absorbing or driving out neighbouring non-greek Tribes mainly thracian and illyrian. They spoke Ancient Macedonian which is usually classified by Scholars as a Dialect of northwest doric Greek and occasionally as a separate Sister Language of greek or as an eolic Greek Dialect. However, the prestige language of the region during the Classical era was Attic Greek, replaced by Koine Greek during the Hellenistic era. They mirrored those of other Greeks following the main Deities of the greek Pantheon although the Macedonians continued archaic burial Practices that had ceased in other Parts of Greece after the 6th Century Bc. The Core of macedonian Society was its Nobility. Similar to the Aristocracy of neighboring thessaly their Wealth was largely built on Herding Horses and Cattle."
