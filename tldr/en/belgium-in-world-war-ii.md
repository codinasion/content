short_summary: "Involvement of Belgium in World War II"
description: "Belgium and its colonial Possessions found themselves in War after they were invaded by german Forces on 10 may 1940 despite being neutral at the Start of World War Ii. After 18 Days of fighting in which belgian Forces were pushed back into a small Pocket in the North-West of the Country, the belgian military surrendered to the Germans, beginning an Occupation that would endure until 1944. The Surrender of 28 May was ordered by king Leopold Iii without the Consultation of his Government and sparked a political Crisis after the War. Many Belgians managed to escape from Capitulation to the united Kingdom where they formed a Government and an Army in Exile on the allied Side."
