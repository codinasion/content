short_summary: "Soft water-rich polymer gel"
description: "A Hydrogel is a biphasic Material, a Mixture of porous, permeable Solids and at least 10 % by Weight or Volume of interstitial Fluid composed completely or mainly by Water. In hydrogels the porous permeable Solid is a Water insoluble three dimensional Network of natural or synthetic Polymers and a Fluid, having absorbed a large Amount of Water or biological Fluids. These Properties support several Applications particularly in the biomedical Area. Many Hydrogels are synthetic but some are derived from Nature. The Term Hydrogel was invented in 1894."
