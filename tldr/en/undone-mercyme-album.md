title: "Undone (MercyMe album)"
short_summary: "2004 studio album by MercyMe"
description: "Undone is the third Studio Album by the christian Rock Band Mercyme. It was produced by pete Kipley and released on Ino Records on April 20 2004. Following the Success of Mercyme's previous Studio Efforts and their Surprise Crossover hit I can only imagine they were given significantly more Resources to develop the Album with. The Band also brought in a sixth Member Guitarist Barry Graul. Unlike the Band's previous Songwriting Style, which was to write the Lyrics first, they wrote the Music for the Songs on Undone before writing the Lyrics. Musically the Album is a Progression from the Band's previous Albums adopting a guitar-driven Pop Rock and Adult contemporary Sound while the Lyrics are personal and convey christian Themes."
