short_summary: "Video game played over the Internet"
description: "An online Game is a video Game that is played either partly or primarily via the Internet or any other available Computer Network. Online Games are ubiquitous on modern Gaming Platforms, including Pcs, Consoles and mobile Devices, and span many Genres, including first-person Shooters, Strategy Games, and massively multiplayer online role-playing Games. In 2019 Revenue in the Online Gaming Segment reached 16. 9 billion, with $ 4. 2 billion generated by China and $ 3. 5 billion in the United States. Since the 2010s a common Trend among online Games has been to operate them as Games as a Service using Monetization Schemes such as Loot Boxes and Battle Passes as purchasable Items atop freely-offered Games. Unlike retail Games online Games have the Problem of not being permanent Playable because they require special Servers to function."
