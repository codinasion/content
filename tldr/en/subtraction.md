title: "Subtraction"
short_summary: "One of the four basic arithmetic operations"
description: "Subtraction is one of the four arithmetic Operations along with Addition Multiplication and Division. Subtraction is an Operation that represents the Removal of Objects from a Collection. For example, in the adjacent picture, there are 5 − 2 peaches—meaning 5 peaches with 2 taken away, resulting in a total of 3 peaches. Therefore, the Difference of 5 and 2 is 3 ; that is, 5 − 2 = 3. While typically associated with natural Numbers in arithmetic Subtraction can also represent removing or decreasing physical and abstract Quantities using different Kinds of Objects including negative Numbers Fractions irrational Numbers Vectors Decimals Functions and."
