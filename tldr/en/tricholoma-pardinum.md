short_summary: "Species of agaric fungus endemic to North America, Europe, and parts of Asia"
description: "Tricholoma Pardinum commonly known as the spotted Tricholoma Tiger Tricholoma tigertop Leopard knight or dirty Trich is a gilled Mushroom Spread throughout north America Europe and Parts of Asia. It is generally found in the Beech Woods during the Summer and Fall. Two Subspecies from southern Europe have been described. First officially described by Christiaan Hendrik Persoon in 1801, T. The Pardinum has a confusing taxonomic History that spans two Centuries. In 1762 the german Naturalist Jacob christian Schffer described agaricus Tigrinus with an Illustration corresponding to what is thought to be t. Pardinum, and consequently, the Name Tricholoma Tigrinum has been used erroneously in some european Field Guides."
