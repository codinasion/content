title: "Air mass"
short_summary: "Volume of air defined by its temperature and water vapor content"
description: "In Meteorology an Air Mass is a Volume of Air defined by its Temperature and Humidity. Air Masses can cover many Hundreds or Thousands of square Miles and Adapt to the Characteristics of the Surface below. They are classified according to Latitude and their Continental or Maritime Source Regions. Colder Air Masses are called polar or arctic while warmer Air Masses are considered tropical. Continental and superior Air Masses are dry, while Maritime and Monsoon Air Masses are moist. Weather Fronts separate Air Masses with different Density Characteristics. Once an Air Mass moves away from its Source Region, underlying Vegetation and Water Bodies can quickly modify its Character. Classification Schemes address both the Characteristics and Modification of the Air Mass."
