description: "Sonic Chaos is a 1993 Sega Platform Game for Master System and Game Gear. Players control sonic the Hedgehog and his Sidekick Miles tails Prower in their quest to recover the Chaos Emeralds from Doctor Robotnik who has stolen them to construct nuclear Weapons. Gameplay involves running through Stages, collecting Rings, and defeating Enemies. It is largely based on the Master System Version of sonic the Hedgehog 2 and thus is considered to be a follow-up to that Game. Chaos is the first Sonic Game for the Master System and Game Gear to feature Tails as a separate playable Character with his own unique Abilities."
