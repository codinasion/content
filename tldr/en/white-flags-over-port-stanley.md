title: "White flags over Port Stanley"
short_summary: "Statement by Margaret Thatcher"
description: "At 10:15 pm on the night of 14 June 1982, British prime minister Margaret Thatcher announced to the House of Commons that negotiations had begun for the surrender of the Argentine invasion force in the Falkland Islands, ending the Falklands War. Her Statement noted that 'they are reported to be flying white Flags over Port Stanley', the Capital of the Falklands. It was based on an erroneous Report from a front-line Unit though no white Flags are known to have been flown though argentine Resistance ended and a Ceasefire was in Place. The surrender was finalised by 1:30 am BST on 15 June. Thatcher's Statement was welcomed from all Sides in the House, and she left to join celebrating Crowds in Downing Street. She described it later as probably the proudest Moment in my Life."
