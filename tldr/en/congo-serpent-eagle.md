It is the only Member of the Monotypic Genus Dryotriorchis although it was previously placed in the Family Circaetus. This species is distributed across the african tropical Rainforest including the upper and lower Guinean Forests. This serpent eagle specializes in hunting in these forests’ dark understories. It has two Subspecies the nominate Subspecies dryotriorchis Spectabilis Spectabilis and Dryotriorchis Spectabilis Batesi. Although Monotypic it appears very closely related to circaetus. This Hawk is a medium-sized Bird with distinctive short Round Wings and a long rounded Tail. It has varying Shades of Brown on its Back and has a small Crest. Its Breast is white with variable Amounts of a rufous Wash and in the nominate Subspecies is covered in round blackish Spots. The Subspecies D. S. Batesi only has these Dots on its Flanks.
