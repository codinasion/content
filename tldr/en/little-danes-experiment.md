short_summary: "1951 Greenlandic social experiment"
description: "The little danes Experiment also known as simply the Experiment was a danish Operation in 1951 where 22 greenlandic Inuit Children were sent to danish foster Families in an Attempt to Re-Educ. While the Children were supposed to be Orphans most were not. Six Children were adopted while in Denmark, and sixteen returned to Greenland, only to be placed in Danish-Speaking Orphanages and never live with their Families again. Half the Children experienced mental Health Problems and Half of them died when they were young Adults. After several Years of Demands from greenlandic Officials the danish Government officially apologized in 2020."
