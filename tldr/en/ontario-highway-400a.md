short_summary: "Controlled-access highway in Ontario"
description: "King's Highway 400a was a 400-series Highway in the canadian Province of Ontario that was unsigned and is now the southern End of Highway 11. The short 1. 1-kilometre Freeway Link connected Highway 400 with Highway 11 and Simcoe County Road 93, formerly Highway 93. The Route was created as a Result of an original Segment bypassed by a late 1959 Extension of Highway400 to coldwater. The Highway 400a Route Number was only used internally as the Road has always featured Highway 400 Signage in the southbound Direction and Highway 11 Signage Northbound. In 1997 Highway400A was eliminated when the Road was redesignated as a Continuation of Highway11 resulting in Highway11's southern Terminus being directly at Highway400 while the Rest of Highway11 South from Barrie to toronto was downloaded to municipal Authorities."
