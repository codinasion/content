description: "A Microwave oven or simply microwave is an electric Oven that heats and Cooks Food by exposing it to electromagnetic Radiation in the Microwave Frequency Range. This induces polar Molecules in Food to rotate and produce thermal Energy in a Process known as dielectric Heating. Microwave ovens Heat Foods quickly and efficiently because Excitation is relatively uniform in the Outer 2538 Mm of a homogeneous high-water Product."
