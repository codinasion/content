short_summary: "Spinosaurid theropod dinosaur genus from the Early Cretaceous Period"
description: "Irritator is a Genus of spinosaurid Dinosaurs that lived in what is now brazil during the albian Stage of the early cretaceous Period about 113 to 110 million Years ago. It is known from a near complete Skull found in the Romualdo Formation of the Araripe Basin. Fossil Dealers had acquired this Skull and sold it to the State Museum of natural History Stuttgart. In 1996 the Specimen became the Holotype of the Type Species irritator Challengeri. The Genus Name comes from the Word Irritation reflecting the Feelings of Paleontologists who found that the Skull had been heavily damaged and altered by the Collectors. The species name is a homage to the fictional character Professor Challenger from Arthur Conan Doyle's novels."
