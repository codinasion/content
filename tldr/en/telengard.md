short_summary: "1982 video game"
description: "Telengard is a 1982 Video Game for role-playing Dungeon Crawler developed by Daniel Lawrence and published by Avalon Hill. The Player explores a Dungeon, Fights Monsters with Magic, and Avoids Traps in Real-Time without any Set Mission other than surviving. Lawrence first wrote the Game as Dnd, a 1976 Version of Dungeons & Dragons for the Decsystem-10 Mainframe Computer. He continued to develop Dnd at Purdue University as a Hobby, rewrote the Game for the Commodore Pet 2001 after 1978, and ported it to Apple Ii+, Trs-80, and Atari 800 Platforms before Avalon Hill found the Game at a Convention and licensed it for Distribution. Its Commodore 64 Release was the most popular. Reviewers noted Telengard's Similarity to dd. RPG historian Shannon Appelcline noted the game as one of the first professionally produced computer role-playing games, and Gamasutra's Barton considered Telengard consequential in what he deemed 'The Silver Age' of computer role-playing games preceding the golden age of the late 1980s. Some of the Game's Dungeon Features, such as Altars, Fountains, Teleportation Cubes, and Thrones, were adopted by later Games such as Tunnels of Doom."
