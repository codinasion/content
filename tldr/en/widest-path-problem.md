title: "Widest path problem"
short_summary: "Path-finding using high-weight graph edges"
description: "In Graph algorithms the widest Path Problem is the Problem of finding a Path between two designated Vertices in a weighted Graph maximizing the Weight of the minimum-weight Edge in the Path. The widest Path Problem is also known as the maximum Capacity Path Problem. It is possible to adapt most shortest Path Algorithms to compute widest Paths by modifying them to use bottleneck Distance instead of Path Length. However, in many Cases even faster Algorithms are possible."
