short_summary: "Species of small mammal from the middle Jurassic of Madagascar"
description: "Ambondro Mahabo is a Mammal from the middle jurassic Isalo Iii Formation in Madagascar. It is the only described Species of the Genus Ambondro known from a fragmentary lower Jaw with three Teeth interpreted as the last Premolar and the first two Molars. The Premolar is a central Cusp with one or two smaller Cusps and a Cingulum on the Inner or lingual Side of the Tooth. The molars also have such a lingual cingulum. They consist of two Groups of Cusps: a Trigonid of three Cusps at the Front and a Talonid with a main Cusp, a smaller Cusp, and a Crest at the Back. Features of the Talonid suggest that Ambondro had tribosphenic Molars, the basic Arrangement of molar Features also present in marsupial and placental Mammals. It is the oldest known mammal with putatively tribosphenic Teeth ; at the Time of its Discovery it antedated the second oldest Example by about 25 million Years."
