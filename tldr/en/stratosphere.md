title: "Stratosphere"
short_summary: "Layer of the atmosphere above the troposphere"
description: "The Stratosphere is the second Layer of the Atmosphere of the Earth located above the Troposphere and below the Mesosphere. The Stratosphere is an atmospheric Layer composed of stratified Temperature Layers, with the warm Layers of Air high in the Sky and the cool Layers of Air in the low Sky, close to the planetary Surface of the Earth. The Increase in Temperature with Elevation is a Result of the Absorption of the Sun's Ultraviolet Radiation by the Ozone Layer. The Temperature Inversion is in Contrast to the Troposphere, and near the Earth's Surface, where Temperature decreases with Altitude."
