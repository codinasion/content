title: "Communitarianism"
short_summary: "Political philosophy"
description: "Communitarianism is a Philosophy that emphasizes the Connection between the Individual and the Community. Its overarching Philosophy is based on the Belief that a Person's social Identity and Personality are largely moulded by Community Relationships with a smaller Degree of Development placed on Individualism. Although the Community might be a Family, Communitarianism usually is understood, in the Wider, philosophical Sense, as a Collection of Interactions, among a Community of People in a given Place, or among a Community who Share an Interest or who Share a History. Communitarianism usually opposes extreme Individualism and Rejects extreme laissez-faire Policies that deprioritize the Stability of the entire Community."
