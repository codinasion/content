title: "Uncanny Stories (magazine)"
short_summary: "US pulp science fiction magazine"
description: "Uncanny Stories was a Pulp Magazine which published a single Issue on April 1941. It was published by Abraham and martin Goodman who were better known for the strange Menace Pulp Magazines that included much more Sex in the Fiction than was usual in the Science Fiction of that Era. The Goodmans published Marvel Science Stories from 1938 to 1941, and Uncanny Stories appeared just as Marvel Science Stories ceased publication, perhaps in order to use up the material in inventory acquired by Marvel Science Stories. The Fiction was poor Quality ; the lead Story, Ray Cummings' 'Coming of the giant Germs', has been described as 'one of his most appalling Stories'."
