description: "Hms Glatton and her sister Ship Gorgon were originally built for the Royal norwegian Navy as Bjrgvin and Nidaros respectively. She was requisitioned from norway at the Beginning of World War I but was not completed until 1918 although she had been launched more than three Years earlier. On september 16 1918 she suffered a huge Fire in one of her 6-inch Magazines before even going into Action she had to be scuttled to prevent an Explosion of her main Magazines that would have devastated Dover. Her Wreck was partly salvaged in 1926 and moved to a Position in the northeastern End of the Port where it would not block Traffic. It was subsequently buried under the current Car Ferry Terminal by a Landfill."
