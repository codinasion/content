title: "Cy-près doctrine in English law"
short_summary: "Doctrine concerning charitable trusts"
description: "The Doctrine of Cy-Pres in english Law is an Element of Trusts Law that Deals with charitable Trusts. The Doctrine States that when such a Trust has failed because its Purposes are either impossible or can not be fulfilled the high Court of Justice or the Charity Commission can issue an Order redirecting the Trust's Funds to the nearest possible Purpose. For charities worth under £5,000 and without land, the trustees may decide to redirect the trust's funds. The Doctrine was initially Part of ecclesiastical Law, originating from the Norman French Phrase Cy Près Comme possible, but similar and possibly ancestral Provisions have been found in Roman Law, both in the Corpus Juris Civilis and later Byzantine Law."
