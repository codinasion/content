title: "Infrasound"
short_summary: "Vibrations with frequencies lower than 20 hertz"
description: "Infrasound, sometimes referred to as low Frequency Sound, describes sound Waves with a Frequency below the lower Limit of human Audibility. Hearing Becomes gradually less sensitive as Frequency Decreases, so for Humans to perceive Infrasound, the sound Pressure must be sufficiently high. While the Ear is the primary Organ for sensing low Sound at higher Intensities it is possible to feel infrasound Vibrations in various Parts of the Body."
