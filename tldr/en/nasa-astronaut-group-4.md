While the Astronauts of the first two Groups were required to have an undergraduate Degree or the professional Equivalent in Engineering or the Sciences they were chosen for their Experience as Test Pilots. Test Pilot Experience was waived as a Requirement for the third Group, and military Jet Fighter Aircraft Experience could be substituted. Group 4 was the first chosen on the basis of research and academic experience, with NASA providing pilot training as necessary. The national Academy of Sciences conducted an initial Screen of Applicants."
