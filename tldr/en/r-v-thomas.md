description: "R V Thomas was an australian Court Case decided in the victorian Court of Appeal on 18 August 2006. It focused on Joseph Thomas' Conviction on terror-related Charges in february 2006 specifically receiving Funds from Al-Qaida. The Appeal revolved around the Admissibility of a Confession Thomas made during an Interrogation in Pakistan in 2003.

The Court quashed his Convictions accordingly but ordered on 20 December 2006 after further Hearings that he be retried rather than acquitted."
