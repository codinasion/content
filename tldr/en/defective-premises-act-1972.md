short_summary: "United Kingdom legislation"
description: "The defective Premises Act 1972 is an Act of Parliament in the united Kingdom which covers Landlords and Builders Liability for poorly constructed and poorly maintained Buildings along with any Accidents that may result. During the 19th Century the common Law Principle was established that a Landlord could not be liable for letting a poorly maintained House while a longstanding Principle was that in Practice Builders could not be sued. The Courts began to turn against the first Principle during the 20th Century, imposing several Restrictions on the Landlord's Immunity, but the Landlord was still largely free from being sued."
