description: "Quainton Road Railway Station was opened in 1868 in undeveloped Countryside near Quainton in the english County of Buckinghamshire 44 Miles from London. Built by the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway, it was the result of pressure from the 3rd Duke of Buckingham to route the railway near his home at Wotton House and to open a railway station at the nearest point to it. Serving a relatively underpopulated Area, Quainton Road was a crude Railway Station, described as 'extremely primitive'."
