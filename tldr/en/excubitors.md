title: "Excubitors"
short_summary: "Byzantine imperial guards"
description: "The Excubitors were founded in C. 460 as an imperial Guard-Unit by the Byzantine Emperor Leo i the Thracian. The 300-strong Force originally recruited from the Warlike Mountain Tribe of the Isaurians replaced the older Scholae Palatinae as the main imperial Bodyguards. The Excubitors remained an active military Unit for the next two Centuries although they rarely went on War Campaign as imperial Bodyguards. Their Commander, the Count of the Excubitors, soon acquired great Influence. Justin I was able to use this position to rise to the throne in 518, and thereafter the Counts of the Excubitors were among the main political power-holders of their day; two more, Tiberius II Constantine and Maurice, rose to become emperors in the late 6th century."
