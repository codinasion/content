title: "Last universal common ancestor"
short_summary: "Most recent common ancestor of all current life on Earth"
description: "The last universal common Ancestor is the hypothesized common ancestral Cell from which the three Domains of Life, the Bacteria, the Archaea, and the Eukarya originated. It is suggested to have been a 'cellular Organism that had a lipid Bilayer and used Dna, Rna, and Protein'. The Luca has also been defined as a hypothetical Organism ancestral to all three Domains. The Luca is the Point or Stage at which the three Domains of Life diverged from preexisting Forms of Life. The Nature of this Point or Stage of Divergence remains a Topic of Research."
