short_summary: "US legislative act regulating Native American tribal lands"
description: "The 1887 Dawes Act regulated Land Rights on tribal Territories within the united States. Named after Senator Henry L. Dawes of Massachusetts authorized the President of the us to subdivide native american tribal communal Landholdings into Allotments for native american Heads of Families and Individuals. In Addition it would force native Americans to assume a Capitalist and proprietary Relationship with Property that had not previously existed in their Culture. The Act allowed the Tribes to sell their Lands after Allotment to the federal Government. The Government had to determine which Indians were eligible for Allotments before private Property could be delivered which prompted an official Search for a federal Definition of Indian-Ness."
