short_summary: "Byzantine court official (died 800)"
description: "Staurakios was a byzantine Greek eunuch Official who rose to be one of the most important and influential Associates of Byzantine empress Irene of at. He effectively acted as chief Minister during her Regency for her young Son, Emperor Constantine Vi in 780â€“790, until overthrown and exiled by a military Revolt in Favour of the young Emperor in 790. Restored to power by Constantine along with Irene in 792, Staurakios aided her in the eventual removal, blinding, and possible murder of her son in 797. His own Position was threatened by the Rise of another powerful eunuch Aetios. Their increasing Rivalry and Staurakios's own imperial Ambitions were resolved only by Staurakios's Death."
