short_summary: "Rules by which information encoded within genetic material is translated into proteins"
description: "The genetic Code is a Set of Rules used by living Cells to translate Information encoded within genetic Material into Proteins. Translation is accomplished by the ribosome, which links proteinogenic amino acids in an order specified by messenger RNA , using transfer RNA molecules to carry amino acids and to read the mRNA three nucleotides at a time. The genetic Code is highly similar among all Organisms and can be expressed in a simple Table with 64 Entries."
