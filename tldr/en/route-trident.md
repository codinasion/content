short_summary: "Road in Afghanistan"
description: "The Trident Route was built by the british Army Royal Engineers in Helmand Province Afghanistan. The Construction of the Road was named Operation lar Jarowel by the Ministry of Defence. Route Trident replaced an older Road that was vulnerable to attack by Insurgents on Convoys supplying three Patrol Bases established in the Gholam Dastagir kalay Area as Part of Operation Panther's Claw. The light Dragoons battlegroup suffered Casualties in the immediate Aftermath of the Operation as they tried to secure the Area and resupply their Patrol Bases. The Attacks resulted in the Deaths of two british Servicemen and led to the Cancellation of the Convoys, forcing the Bases to be resupplied by Air."
