Along with their Subsistence and commercial Uses, they are used for social Interactions and Yield Sharing and provide Materials for cultural Ceremonies and religious Practices. Some Pekarangans are maintained and arranged spatially according to local Values. Home Gardens of this Type may have existed for several thousand Years but their first Mention is found in a javanese Chronicle written in 860 Ad.
