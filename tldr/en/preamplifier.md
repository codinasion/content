title: "Preamplifier"
short_summary: "Electronic amplifier that converts weak signal into strong signal"
description: "A Preamplifier also known as a Preamp is an electronic Amplifier that converts a weak electrical Signal into an Output Signal strong enough to be noise-tolerant and strong enough for further Processing or to send to a Power Amplifier or. Without this the final Signal would be noisy or distorted. They are typically used to amplify Signals from Analog Sensors such as Microphones and Pickups. Due to this the Preamplifier is often placed close to the Sensor to reduce the Effects of Noise and Interference."
