description: "Drosera anglica commonly known as the english Sundew or great Sundew is a carnivorous Flowering Plant Species belonging to the Family Droseraceae. It is a temperate Species with a Circumboreal Range although it occurs as far south as Japan south Europe and the Island of Kauai in Hawaii where it grows as a tropical Sundew. It is thought to have originated from an amphidiploid Hybrid of D. Rotundifolia and D. Linearis meant that a sterile Hybrid between these two Species doubled its Chromosomes to produce fertile Progeny that stabilized into the current D. Anglica."
