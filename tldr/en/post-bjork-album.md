short_summary: "1995 studio album by Björk"
description: "Post is the second studio album by Icelandic singer Björk. It was released by one little indian Records on June 7 1995. Continuing the Style developed on her first Album Debut, Björk conceived of Post as a Bolder and more extroverted Set of Songs than its Predecessor, featuring an eclectic Mixture of electronic and Dance Styles such as Techno, Trip Hop, Idm, and House, but also ambient, Jazz, industrial, and experimental Music. Björk produced Post herself with Co-Producers including Nellee Hooper, 808 State's Graham Massey, and former Massive Attack Member Tricky. After moving to london she wrote most of the Songs and intended the Album to reflect her new Life in the City."
