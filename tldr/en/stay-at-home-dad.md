description: "A stay-at-home Dad is a Father who is the primary Caregiver of the Children and is generally the Homemaker of the Household. The female Equivalent is a stay-at-home Mother or Housewife. As families have evolved, the practice of being a stay-at-home dad has become more common and socially acceptable. In the Days before Industrialization the Family worked together as a Unit and was self-sufficient. When affection-based Marriages emerged in the 1830s Parents began to devote more Attention to Children and Family Relationships were more open.
