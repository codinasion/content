short_summary: "Descending below the surface of the water to interact with the environment"
description: "Underwater diving as a human Activity is the Practice of descending below the Water's Surface to interact with the Environment. It is also often referred to as Diving, an ambiguous Term with several possible Meanings, depending on Context. Immersion in Water and Exposure to high Ambient Pressure have physiological Effects that limit the Depths and Duration of ambient Pressure diving possible. Humans are not physiologically and anatomically well-adapted to the environmental Conditions of diving diverse Equipment has been developed to extend the Depth and Duration of human Dives and allow different Types of Work to be."
