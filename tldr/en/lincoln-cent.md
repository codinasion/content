short_summary: "One-cent United States coin"
description: "The Lincoln Cent is a one-cent Coin that has been struck by the us Mint since 1909. The Obverse or Head Side was designed by Victor David Brenner as was the original Reverse depicting two Stalks of Wheat. The Coin has seen several Reverse or Tail Designs and now bears one by lyndall Bass showing a Union Shield. All Coins struck by the united States Government with a Value of 1100 of a Dollar are called Cents because the united States has always struck Coins using Decimals. The Nickname of the Penny is a Carryover from the Coins struck in England which went to decimal in 1971 for the Coins."
