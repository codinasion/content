The Action was a minor Part of the atlantic Campaign of may 1794 a Campaign that culminated in the Battle of glorious first in June and was unusual in that the french Ship Castor had only been in french Hands for a few Days at the Time. Castor had previously been a british Ship taken by a french Battle Squadron in the Bay of Biscay on 19 may and converted while still at Sea to french Service. While the main Fleets manoeuvered around each other Castor was withdrawn in Pursuit of a dutch Merchant Ship and on may 29 encountered the smaller independent cruising british Ship Hms Carysfor."
