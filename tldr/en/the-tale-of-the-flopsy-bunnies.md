short_summary: "Children's book by Beatrix Potter"
description: "The Tale of Flopsy Bunnies is a Children's Book written and illustrated by beatrix Potter and first published by frederick Warne Co. In July 1909. After writing two complete Tales about Rabbits Potter became weary of the Subject and was reluctant to write another. She realized however that Children most enjoyed her Rabbit Stories and Pictures, and so reached back to Characters and Plot Elements from the Tale of Peter Rabbit and the Tale of Benjamin Bunny to create the Flopsy Bunnies. The Background for the Illustrations was a semi-formal Garden of Archways and Flowerbeds in Wales at the Home of her Uncle and Aunt."
