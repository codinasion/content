description: "The east River Bridge is a multi-span Bridge in Sheet Harbour Nova Scotia which carries Trunk7 and the scenic Route Marine Drive over the northeast Arm of Sheet Harbour. The Bridge is 183 Meters long and was built from September 2014 until december 2015. It was opened on December 17, 2015 to Pedestrians, with a Bridge Walk commemorating the Closing of the old Bridge and the Opening of the new Bridge. The Bridge was open to Vehicles the next Day. It replaced a green Steel Arch Bridge of the same Name that was built North of the current Bridge in 1956. The previous Bridge had a Span of 213 Metres and shared Engineering Connections with the Angus L Bridge. Macdonald Bridge in Halifax. Nova Scotia considered fixing the old Bridge but ultimately chose to build a new Bridge instead. The current Bridge was designed without overhead Arches unlike its Predecessor since the Construction Cost would have been doubled."
