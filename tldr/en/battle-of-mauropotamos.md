description: "The Battle of Mauropotamos was fought at Mauropotamos between the Armies of the Byzantine Empire and the Abbasid Calip. After a failed Byzantine Attempt to recover the Emirate of Crete in the previous Year the Abbasids launched a Raid into Asia Minor. The Byzantine Regent Theoktistos led the Army which went to meet the Invasion but was heavily defeated and many of his Officers defected to the Arabs. Internal Troubles however prevented the Abbasids from exploiting their Victory. A Truce and a Prisoner Exchange were thus agreed in 845 followed by a six-year Ceasefire as both Powers focused their Attention elsewhere."
