description: "Tafl Games are a Family of ancient northern european Strategy Board Games played on a checkered or latticed Board with two Armies of uneven Numbers. Most probably they are based upon the Roman Game Ludus Latrunculorum. Names of different Variants of Tafl include Hnefatafl, Tablut, Tawlbwrdd, Brandubh, Ard Rí, and Alea Evangelii. Games in the tafl Family were played in Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Iceland, Britain, Ireland, and Sápmi. Tafl Gaming was eventually supplanted by Chess in the 12th Century, but the tafl Variant of the Sámi People, Tablut, was in Play until at least the 18th Century. The Tablut Rules were written down by swedish Naturalist Linnaeus in 1732 and were translated in 1811 from Latin to english. All modern Tafl Games are based on the Translation from 1811 which had many Errors. New Rules were added to amend the Problems caused by these Errors these Changes led to the Creation of a modern Family of Tafl Games. The Game of Tablut is now also played according to its original Rules which have been retranslated."
