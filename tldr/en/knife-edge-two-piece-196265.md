short_summary: "Bronze sculpture by Henry Moore"
description: "The Knife Edge two Piece 196265 is an abstract Bronze Sculpture by Henry Moore. It is one of Moore's earliest Sculptures in two Pieces, a Mode that he started to adopt in 1959. Its Form was inspired by the Shape of a Bone Fragment. In 1962 Moore created the Sculpture using an Edition of 10 working Models these working Models are now in public Collections. Between 1962 and 1965 Moore created four full-size Casts with one retained by him. The three Casts are on public Display on College Green in Westminster, London ; Queen Elizabeth Park in Vancouver ; and the Garden at Kykuit, the House of the Rockefeller Family in Tarrytown, New York. Moore's own Cast is displayed in his former Studio and Estate Hoglands in Perry green Hertfordshire in southern England. A similar Work, Mirror Knife Edge 1977, is displayed at the Entrance to i. M. The eastern Section of the national Gallery of Art in Washington Dc. C. The Westminster Cast was donated by Moore through the Contemporary Art Society to what he believed was the City of London, but its actual Ownership was undetermined for many Years. The Westminster cast subsequently fell into Disrepair, and was restored in 2013 after it became Part of the british Parliamentary Art Collection ; it was granted a Grade Ii * Listing in January 2016."
