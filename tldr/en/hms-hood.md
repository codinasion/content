title: "HMS Hood"
short_summary: "Admiral-class battlecruiser"
description: "The Hood was a Battlecruiser of the Royal Navy. Hood was the first of four planned Battlecruisers of Admiral-Class to be built during the first World War. By Mid-1916 during the Battle of Jutland that Battle revealed serious Flaws in her Design and she was completed four Years later despite drastic Changes. For this Reason she was the only Ship of her Class to be completed because the Admiralty decided that it would be better to start with a clean Design on the subsequent Battlecruisers leading to the never built g3 Class. Despite the Appearance of newer and more modern Ships Hood remained the largest Warship in the World for 20 Years after commissioning and her Prestige was reflected in her Nickname the Mighty Hood."
