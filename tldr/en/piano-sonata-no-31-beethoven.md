short_summary: "1822 piano sonata by Ludwig van Beethoven"
description: "The Piano sonata no. 31 in A♭ major, Op. 110 by Ludwig Van Beethoven was composed and published in 1821. It is the middle Piano Sonata in the Group of three he wrote between 1820 and 1822 and is the Penultimate of his Piano Sonatas. Though the Sonata was commissioned in 1820 Beethoven did not start Work on Op. 110 until the latter Half of 1821, and final Revisions were completed in early 1822. The Delay was due to Factors such as Beethoven's Work on Missa Solemnis and his Deteriorating Health. The original Edition was published without Dedication in 1822 by Schlesinger in Paris and Berlin and a english Edition was published in 1823 by Muzio Clementi."
