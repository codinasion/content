short_summary: "Church cantata by Johann Sebastian Bach"
description: "Johann Sebastian Bach composed the church cantata O Ewigkeit, du Donnerwort, BWVÂ 20, in Leipzig for the first Sunday after Trinity and first performed it on 11 June 1724. Bach composed it when he began his second Year as Thomaskantor in Leipzig. It is the first Cantata he composed for his second annual Cycle which was planned to contain choral Cantatas each based on a Lutheran Hymn. The Cantata is focused on Johann rist's 1642 Hymn O Ewigkeit Du Donnerwort with a Johann Schop Chorale Melody. For Bach's choral Cantatas to come in the Cycle selected hymn Stanzas were retained while the Others were paraphrased by a contemporary Poet who transformed their Ideas into a Sequence of alternate Recitatives and Arias. For this Cantata the first Stanza was used unchanged and two more Stanzas were used to conclude the two Parts of the Cantata. The first Part was performed before the Sermon, the second Part after the Sermon. The first Part is in seven Movements and the second Part is in four Movements."
