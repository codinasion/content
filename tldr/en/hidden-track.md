title: "Hidden track"
short_summary: "Music not detectable by casual listeners"
description: "A hidden Track in the Field of recorded Music is a Song or Piece of Audio that has been placed on a Cd Audio Cassette Lp or other recorded Medium in such a Way as to avoid Detection by the casual Listener. In some Cases the Piece of Music may have simply been left off the List while in other Cases more elaborate Methods are used. In rare Cases a'hidden Track' is actually the Result of an Error encountered during the Mastering Stage Recording of the recorded Media. The Inclusion of Hidden Tracks has declined on Studio Albums since the Rise of digital and streaming Services such as Itunes and spotify in the late 2000s and early 2010s."
