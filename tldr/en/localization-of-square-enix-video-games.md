It has not always released all of its Games in all major Regions, and continues to selectively release Games even Today depending on multiple Factors such as the Viability of Platforms or the Condition of the Game itself. The Process of Localization has changed during that Time from having a one-person Team with a short Time and tight Memory Capacities to having a Team of Translators preparing simultaneous Launches in multiple Languages."
