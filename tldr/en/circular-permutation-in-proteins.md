title: "Circular permutation in proteins"
short_summary: "Arrangement of amino acid sequence"
description: "A circular Permutation is a Relationship between Proteins where Proteins have different Order of Amino Acids in their Peptide Sequence. The Result is a protein Structure with different Connectivity but overall similar three-dimensional Shape. In 1979, the first Pair of circularly permuted Proteins – concanavalin A and lectin – were discovered ; over 2000 such Proteins are now known."
