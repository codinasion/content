title: "M-theory"
short_summary: "Framework of superstring theory"
description: "M-Theory is a Theory in Physics which unifies all consistent Versions of superstring Theory. Edward witten first conjectured the Existence of such a Theory at a 1995 String Theory Conference at the University of southern California. Witten's Announcement inspired a Flurry of Research Activities known as the second Superstring Revolution. Prior to witten's Announcement String Theorists identified five Versions of superstring Theory. Although these Theories initially appeared very different Work by many Physicists showed that the Theories were related in Intricate and nontrivial Ways. Physicists found that apparently distinct Theories could be unified by mathematical Transformations called S-Duality and T-Duality. Witten's Conjecture was in Part based on the Existence of these Dualities and partly on the Relationship between string Theories and a Field Theory called eleven-dimensional Supergravity."
