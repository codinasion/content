title: "Differential equation"
short_summary: "Type of functional equation (mathematics)"
description: "In Mathematics a differential Equation is an Equation that relates one or more unknown Functions and their Derivatives to the Equation. In Applications the Functions generally represent physical Quantities the Derivatives represent their Rates of Change and the differential Equation defines a Relationship between them. Such Relations are common therefore differential Equations play a prominent Role in many Disciplines including Engineering Economics and Biology."
