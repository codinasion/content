short_summary: "Imperial Russian Navy's Ekaterina II-class ironclad battleship"
description: "Georgii Pobedonosets was a Battleship built for the Imperial Russian Navy, the fourth and final Ship of the Ekaterina Ii Class. She was, however, only a Half-Sister to the Others as her Armor Scheme was different and she was built much later than the earlier Ships. In June 1905 she participated in the Pursuit of the mutinous Battleship Potemkin but her Crew mutinied themselves. Loyal Crew Members however regained Control of the Ship the next Day and ran it aground when Potemkin threatened to fire on her if she left odessa Harbor. She was relegated to second Line Duties in 1908. She fired on Smsgoeben during her Bombardment of Sevastopol in 1914 but spent most of the War Serving as a Base Ship in Sevastopol. She was captured during the russian civil War by both Sides but ended up being towed to bizerte by the fleeing white Russians where she was eventually scrapped."
