short_summary: "Graphical representation of an electrical circuit"
description: "A Circuit Diagram is a graphic Representation of an electrical Circuit. A pictorial Circuit Diagram uses simple Images of Components while a schematic Diagram shows the Components and Interconnections of the Circuit using standardized symbolic Representations. The Presentation of Interconnections between Circuit Components in the schematic Diagram does not necessarily correspond to the physical Arrangements of the finished Device."
