short_summary: "Coats of arms given to a person retrospectively"
description: "Attributed Arms are western european Coats of Arms given retrospectively to Persons real or fictitious who died in the latter Half of the 12th Century before the Start of the Age of Heraldry. Once Coats of Arms were the established Fashion of the Ruling Class, Society expected a King to be armigerous. Arms were assigned to the Knights of the Round Table and then to biblical Figures to roman and greek Heroes and to Kings and Popes who had historically not carried Arms. Individual Authors sometimes attributed different Arms to the same Person although the Arms for major Figures eventually became fixed."
