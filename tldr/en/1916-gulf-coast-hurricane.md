The second tropical Cyclone first Hurricane and the first major Hurricane Category 3 or stronger on the modern-day Scale of the highly active atlantic Hurricane Season in 1916 originated on June 28 in the southwestern caribbean Sea and moved generally north-northwest. As a strengthening Hurricane crossing the Yucatn Channel on July 3 and brushing Cuba with gusty Winds the Cyclone reached its peak Intensity with Maximum sustained Winds of 120mph before making Landfall on July 5 in Pascagoula Mississippi. Over Land, the Hurricane rapidly weakened to a tropical Storm, but then retained much of its remaining Strength as it meandered across interior Mississippi and Alabama for several Days, its northward Progress impeded by a sprawling high-pressure Area to the North. The System weakened into a tropical Depression on 9 July and dissipated over southern Tennessee late the next Day."
