short_summary: "Exoplanet orbiting Kepler-11"
description: "Kepler-11B is an Exoplanet found in the Vicinity of the Star Kepler-11 by nasa-led Spacecraft - a Mission to discover earth-like Planets. Kepler-11B is less than three Times as massive and twice as large as Earth but it has a smaller Density and is therefore probably not of an earth-like Composition. Kepler-11B is the Hottest of the six Planets in the Kepler-11 System and orbits closer to kepler-11 than the other Planets in the System. Kepler-11B, along with its five Counterparts, form the first discovered planetary System with more than three transiting Planetsâ€”The most densely packed known planetary System. The System is also the flattest known planetary System. On february 2 2011 the Discovery of this Planet and five sister Planets was announced after follow-up Investigations."
