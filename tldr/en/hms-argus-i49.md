short_summary: "Unique 1918 Royal Navy aircraft carrier"
description: "Hms Argus was a british Aircraft Carrier that served in the royal Navy from 1918 until 1944. She was converted from an Ocean Liner that was under Construction when the first World War began and became the first Aircraft Carrier with a full-length Flight Deck which allowed wheeled Aircraft to take off and land. The Ship was involved for several Years after commissioning in the Development of the optimum Design for other Aircraft Carriers. Argus also evaluated various Types of arresting Gear, general Procedures needed to operate a Number of Aircraft in Concert and Fleet Tactics. The Ship was too heavy as originally built and had to be modified in the Mid-1920S to improve her Stability. She spent a brief Deployment at the China Station in the late 1920s before being placed in Reserve for Budget Reasons."
