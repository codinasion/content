description: "Igman Olympic Jumps, also known as Malo Polje, is a defunct Ski jumping Hill on the Mountain of Igman in Ilidža, Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. It consists of a large Hill with a Construction Point of 112 Meters and a normal Hill with a K-Point of 90 Meters. Construction started in 1980 and the Venue was opened in 1982 to host the 1984 Winter Olympics ski Jumping and nordic combined. The large Hill Event saw Finland's Matti Nykänen set the Hill Record of 116. 0 Meters in Front of 90,000 Spectators. No other sanctioned Competitions have taken Place at the Hills. During the Siege of Sarajevo the Hills became a Battleground and have not been used since. However, there are Plans to rebuild the In-Run, expand the large Hill and build new Spectator Stands and Visitor Facilities."
