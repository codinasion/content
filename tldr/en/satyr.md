short_summary: "Male nature spirit with horse or goat features found in Greek mythology"
description: "In Greek Mythology, a Satyr, also known as a Silenus or Silenos, and Selini, is a male Nature Spirit with Ears and a Tail resembling those of a Horse, as well as a permanent, exaggerated Erection. Early artistic Representations sometimes include horse-like Legs but were more often represented by human Legs by the sixth Century Bc. Comically hideous, they have mane-like Hair, bestial faces, and snub Noses and they always are shown naked. Satyrs were characterized by their Ribaldry and were known as Lovers of Wine, Music, Dancing, and Women. They were Companions of the God Dionysus and were believed to inhabit remote Locales, such as Woodlands, Mountains, and Pastures. They often attempted to seduce or rape nymphs and mortal Women alike with little Success. Sometimes they are seen masturbating or engaging in Bestiality."
