title: "Enzyme"
short_summary: "Large biological molecule that acts as a catalyst"
description: "Enzymes are proteins that Act by accelerating chemical Reactions as biological Catalysts. The Molecules on which Enzymes may act are called Substrates and the Enzyme converts the Substrates into different Molecules known as Products. Almost all metabolic Processes in the Cell need enzyme Catalysis to occur in a quick enough Rate to sustain Life. Metabolic Pathways depend on Enzymes to catalyze individual Steps. The Study of Enzymes is called Enzymology and the Field of pseudoenzyme Analysis recognizes that during Evolution some Enzymes have lost the Ability to carry out biological Catalysis reflected in their Amino Acid Sequences and unusual'Pseudocatalytic'."
