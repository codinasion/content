short_summary: "Techniques and procedures for safe decompression of divers"
description: "To prevent or reduce Decompression Sickness Divers must correctly plan and monitor Decompression. Divers use a Decompression Model to safely allow the Release of inert Gases in their Body Tissues which are accommodated by breathing at Ambient Pressures greater than Surface atmospheric Pressure. Decompression Models take into Account Variables such as Depth and Time of Dive, breathing Gasses, Altitude, and Equipment to develop appropriate Procedures for safe Ascent."
