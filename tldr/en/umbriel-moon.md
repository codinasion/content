short_summary: "Moon of Uranus"
description: "Umbriel is a lunar Moon of Uranus discovered by William Lassell on october 24 1851. It was discovered at the same Time as Ariel and named after a Character in Alexander Pope's Poem the Rape of the Lock 1712. Umbriel consists mainly of Ice with a substantial Fraction of Rock, and may be differentiated into a rocky Core and an Icy Mantle. The Surface is the Darkest among uranian Moons and appears to have primarily been shaped by Impacts. However, the Presence of Canyons Suggests early endogenic Processes, and the Moon may have undergone an early endogenically driven resurfacing Event that obliterated its older Surface."
