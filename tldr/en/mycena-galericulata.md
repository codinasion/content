short_summary: "Species of fungus"
description: "Mycena Galericulata is a Species of Mushroom known as the common Bonnet the Toque mycena the common Mycena or the Rosagill Fairy Helmet. The Type Species of the Genus Mycena was first scientifically described in 1772 but was not considered Mycena until 1821. It is quite variable in Color, Size, and Shape, which makes it somewhat difficult to reliably identify in the Field. The Mushrooms have Caps with distinct radial Grooves particularly at the Margin. The Cap's Color Varies from grayish brown to dark brown and the Shape ranges from Bell-Like to bluntly conical to flattened with an Umbo. The Stem is hollow, white, tough and thin, without a Ring and often roots deeply into the Wood on which it grows. The Gills are white to grayish or even pinkish when Mature and connected by separate Crosses. The Caps can reach 4 Cm in Diameter, and have a mealy Odor and Taste. At Maturity the Spore Print is white and the Gills are pink which can lead to possible Confusion with Species of the Genus Pluteus. M. Galericulata Mushrooms grow mostly in Clusters on the well-decayed Stumps of deciduous and coniferous Trees from Spring to autumn. The Species can generally be considered inedible. It is widespread and common in the entire Temperate Zone of the northern hemisphere but it has also been reported from Africa."
