description: "Satellite Science Fiction was an american Science Fiction Magazine that was published by renown Publications of leo Margulies between october 1956 and april 1959. Initially, Satellite was digest-sized and ran a full-length Novel in each Issue with a Handful of short Stories accompanying it. The Move was intended to help it compete against Paperbacks who take a growing Share of the Market. Sam Merwin edited the first two Issues Margulies took over when Merwin left and then hired frank Belknap long for the february 1959 Issue. The Issue saw the format Change to the Letter Size in the Hope that the Magazine would be more prominent on the Newsstand. The Experiment was a Failure and Margulies closed the Magazine when the Sales Figures were published."
