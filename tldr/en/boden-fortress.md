short_summary: "Fortress in Norrbotten County, Sweden"
description: "Boden Fortress is a modern Fortress Consisting of several major and minor Forts and Fortifications around the City of boden Norrbotten in northern Sweden. The Fortress originally was intended to stop or delay Attacks from the East or Coastal Assaults which meant russian Attacks launched from Finland at the Time of Construction. It was primarily the Expansion of the Railway Net in Norrland that was a Consequence of the increasing Importance of the northern Iron Ore Fields that led to the increased strategic Value of northern Sweden and the Construction of the Fortress. Although the main Forts were finished in 1908 many of the supporting Fortifications were not finished until the Start of the first World War. Throughout the History of both World Wars there were also continuous Improvements."
