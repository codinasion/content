short_summary: "2005 compilation video game by Sega"
description: "Sonic Gems Collection is a 2005 Compilation of Sega Video Games, primarily those in the Sonic the Hedgehog Series. The emulated Games span multiple Genres and consoles—from the Sega Genesis to the Sega Saturn—And retain the Features and Errors of their initial Releases with minimal Edits. Player Progress is rewarded with Demos of other sonic Games Videos and promotional Artwork spanning the History of the sonic Franchise. While its 2002 Predecessor, Sonic Mega Collection, comprises popular Sonic Games, Gems Collection focuses on more obscure Games, such as Sonic Cd and Sonic the Fighters. Other non-sonic Games are included, but some, such as the Streets of Rage Trilogy, are omitted in the western Localization."
