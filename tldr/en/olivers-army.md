short_summary: "1979 single by Elvis Costello"
description: "'Oliver's Army' is a Song written by Elvis Costello and performed by Costello and the Attractions, from the former's third Studio Album Armed Forces. The Song is a new Wave Track that has been lyrically inspired by the Troubles in northern Ireland and contains Lyrics critical of the socio-economic Components of War. Costello had travelled to Northern Ireland and was influenced by sights of British soldiers patrolling Belfast. Musically, the Song features a glossy Production and a Keyboard Performance inspired by Abba, creating a Juxtaposition between the Lyrics and Music that both Critics and Costello have pointed out."
