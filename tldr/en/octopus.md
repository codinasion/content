short_summary: "Soft-bodied eight-limbed order of molluscs"
description: "An Octopus is a soft-bodied eight-limbed Mollusk of the octopodae Family. The Order consists of some 300 Species and is grouped within the Class Cephalopoda with Squids, cuttlefish, and Nautiloids. An Octopus is like other Cephalopods bilaterally symmetric with two Eyes and a beaked Mouth at the Center of the eight Limbs. The soft Body can radically alter its Shape enabling Octopuses to squeeze through small Gaps. They trail their eight Appendages behind them as they swim. The Siphon is used for Respiration and Locomotion by expelling a Jet of Water. Octopuses have a complex nervous system and excellent sight, and are among the most intelligent and behaviourally diverse of all invertebrates."
