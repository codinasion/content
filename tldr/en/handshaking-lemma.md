title: "Handshaking lemma"
short_summary: "Every graph has evenly many odd vertices"
description: "In Graph Theory a Branch of Mathematics the Handshaking Lemma is the Statement that in every Finite undirected Graph the Number of Vertices that touch an odd Number of Edges is even. For Example if there is a Group of People shaking hands the Number of People who shake an odd Number of other People's Hands is even. The Handshaking Lemma is a Consequence of the Degree Sum Formula sometimes also called handshaking Lemma according to which the Sum of the Degrees Equals twice the Number of Edges in the Graph. Both Results have been proved by leonhard Euler in his famous Paper on the seven Bridges of Knigsberg which began the Study of Graph Theory."
